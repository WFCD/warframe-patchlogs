  "changes": "Firstly, Valkyr’s base Health and Armor stats are being increased to provide her with over double the effective Health points. The stats below are at base value.\nValkyr Health: 650 from 270\nValkyr Armor: 855 from 630\nValkyr Prime Health:  650 from 270\nValkyr Prime Armor: 1000 from 735\nValkyr accumulates Rage when killing enemies, increasing her Melee Damage up to 300%. She consumes her Rage (if above 150% in the Rage meter) to prevent death and become invulnerable briefly.\nGain Rage on Melee Kill and Melee Hit. Gain up to 300% Melee Damage based on real-time (i.e., no ‘snapshotting’) Rage amount.\nKills grant a small amount of Rage.\nAssists build Rage—i.e., if Valkyr has Melee struck an enemy, but the kill is secured by another player, Valkyr will earn Rage.\nFinisher Kills and Mercy Kills grant a larger amount of Rage.\nMelee hits grant the least amount of Rage, but can be triggered multiple times per enemy.\nRage stops decaying briefly whenever you gain Rage.\nRage % slowly decays over time without Rage generation.\nConsumes all Rage when dealt lethal damage if the Rage meter is at 150% or above, preventing death and giving Valkyr 5 seconds of invulnerability.\nDeath prevention has no cooldown; simply return to above 150% in the Rage meter to be able to prevent death again!\nRip Line has received adjustments to better accommodate playstyles that seek fast-paced traversal options, alongside increased flexibility in ability cancellation and further enemy grouping capabilities.\nRip Line no longer cancels until Valkyr reaches the end of the line.\nRip Line’s speed and ease-of-use have been updated, with the goal of providing a smoother experience.\nDouble Jump usage is reset upon using Rip Line.\nRip Line can be cancelled by jumping (or pressing melee) during use.\nJumping during Rip Line adds a small, temporary momentum boost to the player’s movement mid-air.\nRip Line’s cast when targeting an enemy will pull Valkyr towards that enemy and group enemies within a 9m radius around her upon reaching her target.\nValkyr will automatically use a Melee attack when arriving at her target.\nThe radius for Rip Line’s grouping scales with Ability Range.\nUpdated Rip Line’s cast and impact SFX.\nWarcry is receiving only minor adjustments, as the ability already fits the bill in her reworked kit. However, Warcry will now be able to buff allies who lose her Warcry buff, alongside additional quality of life tuning!\nWarcry can now be recast.\nWarcry’s base duration increased to 20 seconds from 15 seconds.\nAbility effects spread to allies within Affinity Range (50m, previously 25m)\nPlayers can re-acquire Warcry’s effects when re-entering Valkyr’s Affinity Range. If you die or get nullified, you can return to Valkyr to refresh Warcry!\nWarcry no longer slows enemies—it’s been moved to Paralysis!\nWarcry has received a new casting animation and updated visual effects.\nWarcry can now be cast while moving.\nParalysis now brings additional functionality to double down on the ability to weaken your foes, while reconfiguring it from costing Shields to Energy.\nEnemies struck by Paralysis receive a base 50% Melee Damage Vulnerability.\nMelee Damage Vulnerability scales with Ability Strength.\nEnemies and enemy health bars will receive VFX to indicate their vulnerability when the player actively uses any Melee weapon.\nEnemies struck by Paralysis are slowed by a base 30%.\nThe slow scales with Ability Strength.\nShield cost has been removed. Casting Paralysis now costs 25 Energy.\nSince there’s no Shield cost anymore, a base 400 Impact Damage was added to compensate.\nParalysis has been updated with an upper-body animation to ensure movement isn’t interrupted when casting.\nParalysis’s VFX was updated to appear radial rather than conal.\nParalysis’s previous line of sight check has been updated to our modern version to improve hit-detection reliability.\nThe staple of her kit, Hysteria, pulls together the fantasy of her berserker theme. Now, combined with her new Passive, Hysteria will utilize her Rage to deliver hysterical destruction to any foe in your path.\nHysteria’s Invulnerability has been removed, as Valkyr now triggers invulnerability through her Passive.\nWith this change, the Self-Reflection damage part of Hysteria has been completely removed. In other words, you can no longer die specifically from deactivating Hysteria while enemies are nearby. \nArmor gained from Warcry is increased by 3x during Hysteria for Valkyr.\nCurrently, Valkyr has one of the highest Armor stats, with room to acquire much more, but that Armor became meaningless with Hysteria’s invulnerability. Here, we aim to amplify Valkyr’s Armor capabilities, combined with her death prevention while above 50% of the  Rage meter and Life Steal improvements.\nValkyr is immune to Status Effects while Hysteria is active.\nEnergy Drain caps at 5 Energy per second instead of 15.\nHealing from Hysteria’s Life Steal is now 100 Health per hit.\nHealth gained scales with Ability Strength.\nUpdated Hysteria’s SFX.\nValkyr’s Talons/Hysteria Melee Stance has received various adjustments to accommodate improved mobility, damage and forced Status Effects on her attacks during Hysteria.\nCombo attacks and animations have been updated to remove sudden stops, ensuring mobility is maintained while attacking (e.g., the Fervor Combo no longer stops player movement on the 3rd and 4th hits).\nGuaranteed Slash Status Effects have been added to several attacks in her Combos (excluding her Slide Attack).\nThe Combos receiving Slash Status Effects during certain attacks are:\nFervor (Neutral Combo)\nRage (Forward Combo)\nDelirium (Neutral Block Combo)\nRise From Ashes (Heavy Attack Combo)\nSeveral Combos have received increased Combo Counter gain on attacks:\nFervor (Neutral Combo)\nOld: 1/1/1/1/1/1\nNew: 1/1/2/2/2/3\nDelirium (Neutral Block Combo)\nOld: 1/1/1/1\nNew: 1/1/2/2\nRage (Forward Combo)\nOld: 1/1/1/1\nNew: 2/3/3/3\nMadness (Forward Blocking Combo)\nOld: 1/1/1/1/1/1\nNew: 2/2/2/2/3/3\nSeveral damage multipliers in her Combos increased up to 300%.\nHysteria’s attacks received an increased base Attack Range to 2.15m from 1.7m.\nHysteria IPS is now only Slash (75%) and Puncture (25%)—Impact damage and weighting have been removed entirely.\nImpact felt less useful in Hysteria’s damage distribution, as our goal was to emphasize the essence of Valkyr’s damage-dealing destructive capabilities.\nNew Augment Mods for Kullervo, Citrine, Caliban, and Jade are available to acquire from the Faction Syndicates!\nStats below shown at Max Rank.\nRecompense Augment: Daggers whirl in a ring around Kullervo for 25 seconds, slashing nearby foes and dealing Blast Damage and Status Effect before returning to the ring.\nAvailable in New Loka and Steel Meridian offerings.\nPrismatic Gem Augment: The gem now attaches to your free-moving companion. Passive: +50% Prismatic Gem Duration.\nAvailable in Red Veil and Steel Meridian offerings.\nRazor Gyre Augment: Enemies hit with Razor Gyre are grouped together. Ortholysts summoned by Lethal Progeny launch coordinated strikes upon grouped enemies with 70% Electricity Damage and Fire Rate for 6 seconds.\nAvailable in Cephalon Suda and Perrin Sequence offerings.\nLight's Judgment Augment: Enemies damaged by Jade’s light well have a 5% chance per hit to spawn a Jade Light above them, damaging them for 3 seconds.\nAvailable in Arbiters of Hexis and Red Veil offerings.\nJunctions are vital tools to guide players through the Star Chart, and ensure they learn some of Warframe’s fundamentals. Since their introduction with Specters of the Rail in 2016, we’ve adjusted their Specters, rewards, and tasks over various updates. The Isleweaver update brings a UI refresh and other quality of life changes.\nJunctions offer much information, but players cannot interact with the UI itself. Clicking on a Junction would enter a player into the Junction itself, meaning there was little opportunity for on-hover tooltips or additional information to be provided to players.\n\nPlayers can no longer enter Junctions when all tasks are not completed.\nWhile players would not be able to fight the Specter, entering Junctions early only confused players; now, you can only enter when you’re ready for the Specter showdown. \nThis change shipped with Techrot Encore, but we’re including here for a wider view of all Junction changes.\nImproved on-hover tooltips for tasks and rewards and overall more space to display important information to players.\nInteracting with a Completed Junction will now take you to the connecting planet. Players can still open the Junction screen with the input shown in the UI. \nIncomplete Junctions now display how many tasks remain in the Star Chart.\nJunction Reward + Task Changes\nAlongside the UI refresh, we’ve revisited many Junction tasks to close gaps in player teachings — most importantly, we have changed how rewards are received from Junctions.\nPlayers who have already completed certain Junctions will receive the following rewards in their Inbox on login:\nThe Junction path has been adjusted with linear progression in mind. We’re building on the Star Chart changes from Techrot Encore (reduction of nodes to complete and de-prioritization of the Europa and Ceres Junctions) to help guide players towards completing the Main Story. Tasks have been reworked to help explain key parts of the Warframe experience — ex: equipping and upgrading Mods, and using the Foundry.\nVenus Junction\nJunction Tasks:\nJunction Completion Rewards:\nFuris (was: Furis Blueprint)\n15,000 Credits (was: 5000 Credits)\n* We have also made changes to Taxon’s crafting costs, which we cover in the “Other Junction-Related Changes” section!\nMercury Junction\nJunction Tasks:\nRemoved Task:\nComplete 6 waves of Defense at Tessera on Venus in a single mission.\nJunction Completion Rewards:\nBoltor \n20,000 Credits (was: 10,000 Credits)\nQuests Unlocked:\nOnce Awake\nHowl of the Kubrow\n*We have also made changes to Rhino’s crafting costs, which we cover in the “Other Junction-Related Changes” section!\nMars Junction\nJunction Tasks:\nRemoved Task:\nCollect 250 Rubedo in missions\nJunction Completion Rewards:\nFragor\n25,000 Credits (was: 10,000 Credits)\nQuests Unlocked:\nThe Archwing\nHeart of Deimos\nJupiter Junction\nJunction Tasks:\nThese revised tasks guide players to master their Parkour mechanics, as the Gas City tileset is especially parkour-heavy.\nJunction Completion Rewards:\nAmphis Blueprint \n30,000 Credits\nSaturn Junction\nJunction Tasks:\nRemoved Task:\nDefeat Alad V at Themisto (Jupiter)\nPlayers already have to complete this Node to access the Junction, so we’ve swapped this task for something more instructional.\nJunction Completion Rewards:\nPenta Blueprint\n40,000 Credits \nQuest unlocked: The Deadlock Protocol\nUranus Junction\nJunction Tasks:\nRemoved Tasks:\nOpen 1 Meso Void Relic\nWe moved tasks teaching players how to open Void Relics to Optional Junctions (see the section below), as Relics are not critical for the main story path. \nLearn how to perform Synthesis\nThis task was moved to the Europa Junction as it is not critical to the main story path.\nJunction Completion Rewards:\nLecta Blueprint\n40,000 Credits \nQuest unlocked: The Duviri Paradox\nPlayers also receive a taunting inbox from Tyl Regor once they unlock the Uranus Junction to direct them towards his node, and introduce him as a character.\nNeptune Junction\nJunction Tasks:\nThese tasks are relatively unchanged, as they encourage exploration of the Grineer Sealab tileset in preparation for Natah and The Second Dream.\nJunction Completion Rewards:\nGammacor Blueprint\n80,000 Credits\nQuest unlocked: The Second Dream\nPluto Junction\nJunction Tasks:\nJunction Completion Rewards:\nDrakgoon Blueprint\n80,000 Credits\nQuest unlocked: The War Within\nThe War Within was moved from the Sedna Junction due to the Junction path restructuring.\n\nEris Junction\nJunction Tasks:\nJunction Completion Rewards:\nMire Blueprint\n100,000 Credits\nQuest unlocked: Patient Zero\nSedna Junction\nThe Sedna Junction has been moved from Pluto to Eris to reinforce linear progression for the Main Path.\nJunction Tasks:\nJunction Completion Rewards:\nFang Blueprint\n100,000 Credits\nQuest unlocked: Hidden Messages\nThe following Junctions are “Optional” as they are not critical to the Main Story path. As such, we’ve reorganized their Tasks to focus on important content that isn’t essential for the journey to 1999 (and beyond), but are still vital for players to know about in their Warframe journey.\nPhobos Junction\nJunction Tasks:\nThese revised tasks teach players about Void Relics.\nJunction Completion Rewards:\nKraken blueprint\n20,000 Credits\nQuest unlocked: Stolen Dreams\nNote: the Orokin Catalyst from the Phobos Junction has been moved to the Eris Junction, since this Junction is no longer required for main story progress.\nCeres Junction\nJunction Tasks:\nThese revised tasks teach players about Ayatan Sculptures and Syndicates.\nRemoved Tasks:\nOpen 3 Lith Void Relics\nThis was moved to the Phobos Junction to keep all Void Relic tasks in the same spot. \nDefeat The Sergeant at Iliad (Phobos)\nJunction Completion Rewards:\nVulkar blueprint\n20,000 Credits\nEuropa Junction\nJunction Tasks:\nRemoved Tasks:\nComplete Exterminate Mission at Teshub (Void)\nDue to the restructuring of the Junction path, this Node requires the Phobos Junction to access it.\nJunction Completion Rewards:\nCestra blueprint\n30,000 Credits\nWhile the Star Chart node completion made sense for the initial launch of Arbitrations, the addition of Steel Path meant players unlocked content of varying difficulty from the same mechanic. Arbitrations are widely recommended for players to complete to prepare for the Steel Path, so we’re giving them access to it earlier.\nSince players are now asked to build Taxon in the Venus Junction, we’ve made the following changes to a) make crafting Taxon easier, and b) allow players to gain access to their Sentinel sooner.\nRemoved Polymer Bundle from the Taxon Blueprint.\nReduced build time from 24 hours to 1 minute.\nRhino’s material requirements are being revamped to only require resources from Earth and Venus as building a Rhino Component is now a requirement for the early Junction tasks.\nMain Blueprint: 1 Neurode (was 1 Gallium)\nNeuroptics: 150 Alloy Plates, 1 Neurode (was 1 Morphics), 150 Polymer Bundle, 500 Rubedo \nChassis: 450 Circuits (was 1 Morphics), 1000 Ferrite, 300 Rubedo\nSystems: 500 Ferrite, 250 Circuits, 100 Polymer Bundle, 400 Rubedo\nWas 1 Gallium, 1 Morphics, 500 Salvage, 600 Plastids\n\nCaptain Vor, master of the Janus Key, has received a rework. Since he is a new Tenno’s first introduction to Warframe bosses, our goal is to make his fight more dynamic without being too punishing for new players. This write-up is dedicated to the Normal Path version of his fight; he may have a few more tricks up his sleeve for those who focus.\nTo start off, he’s got a new fancy arena — when players enter the door, they’ll meet him face-to-face. In this new tile, players will see his new and reworked abilities in a better light:\nElectricity grenades: His nervos grenades now spawn actual arc spheres that deal electricity in a wide area.\nElectrical pylons: Vor uses the Janus key to summon a beam of electricity which will target players, similar to the mechanic seen in the Awakening Quest.\nShield: Vor’s health is broken into four segments. Upon losing one segment of health, he’ll cloak himself in the familiar shield orb and spawn reinforcements to protect him.\nTeleport: Largely unchanged, but with some visual updates to indicate where he teleported to.\nAfter losing half of his health (2 health segments), Vor will teleport deeper into his lair. Players will have to navigate tunnels armed with electrical traps to find him. These manifest as simple laser puzzles that players have to parkour through, and are designed to keep new players in mind. Hitting the lasers deals electrical damage, but players won’t be overly punished should they not traverse them perfectly.\nOnce you make it through the tunnel, Vor will be waiting on a series of platforms elevated over an electrified pool. The second half of the fight takes place here, where Vor will unleash a few extra tricks up his sleeve:\nVoid Key Beam: This beam will swipe across the room, requiring players to jump to avoid it.\nElectrical Orbs: (on his final health state) Vor summons an electrical orb above the platform he’s standing on, which will zap anyone nearby. Players can shoot at these orbs to destroy them.\nWe’ve added Arcanes to the end of mission rewards in the Vor fight on the Steel Path. Defeat him for a guaranteed Arcane from the following list\nArcane Battery\nArcane Power Ramp \nArcane Blessing \nArcane Steadfast\nPrimary Obstruct \nCascadia Flare\nSecondary Surge \nMelee Vortex\nWe also added new Accolade Glyphs for Tenno who display certain feats of strength in the Vor fight (wink wink nod nod). Designed by Community Artist Kedemel.\n\nIn April, we ran a New Player Gear Experiment for a small group of iOS players. This experiment sought to learn how providing new Tenno with additional starting gear might affect their journey through the Origin System. This experiment has concluded, and we are applying our learnings to All Platforms:\nAll new players who complete the Awakening Quest for the first time will receive a built version of either the Paris or the Braton (whichever one they did not choose during the first stage of Awakening).\nThe Alternate Primary Weapon will automatically be in the new player’s Arsenal upon completing Awakening.\nNatah is a player’s first real step into Warframe’s main quest line, but this entry point into the story can be abrupt and even confusing.\nPreviously, players would have to scan Oculysts on Uranus to trigger this Quest. Since this Quest is now automatically unlocked after The Archwing, that requirement is gone. Now, players will progress immediately to the “Scan the New Drones” mission on Gaia (Earth) step, with some added tutorialization for scanning:\nThe Lotus will now tell players to equip their scanners before starting the mission.\nThe Lotus will now instruct players how to scan Oculysts if some time has passed without scans.\nWe’ve added a few other transmissions to this mission with the goal of offering a little more narrative context, as well!\nTwo of the main content requirements for The New War were Railjacks and Necramechs. We added loaner Necramechs in Techrot Encore since the Necramech segment didn’t require robust Necramech builds, but the Railjack segments can be difficult for players who haven’t invested in this system up until this point.\nSince players can’t exit the Quest to beef up their Railjack, we have buffed the Railjack’s health, shields, and damage during these segments!\nMissed Note from Techrot Encore: The Archwing Launcher has been added as a Quest Reward from The Archwing Quest.\nThe Archwing Launcher Segment research in Clan Dojos was removed and resources were refunded.\nIn addition to this change, Isleweaver has streamlined the process to start using your Archwing Launcher in Open Landscape missions:\nRemoved the Archwing Launcher Segment and Blueprint entirely. \nPlayers now receive the Archwing Launcher upon completing The Archwing Quest, meaning they’re ready to equip it to their Gear Wheel immediately once they’ve acquired their Archwing.\nRemoved the Archwing Launcher Segment from the Market. \nFor players who purchased the Archwing Launcher Segment for Platinum between Techrot Encore and Isleweaver’s release, we will be refunding your Purchase. We’ll update players once the script has been run.\nPlayers now must complete The War Within before they can play The Rising Tide quest. This is due to a specific character only showing up in a cutscene once you’ve completed The War Within.\nPlayers will no longer have to scan plants to earn their extracts. \nNow, plants like Moonlight Dragonlily and Ruk’s Claw will have a “Hold to Collect” context action to pick them up in-mission. \nOxylus’ Botanist Precept has been changed to automatically pick any plants within  50m over 2s (at max rank). \nThis also applies to the Silver Grove Quest, which requires players to collect certain plant resources to progress. The objective descriptions have been updated to specify “gathering” instead of “scanning”. \nThe scanning mechanic was overly complicated for new players, so this simplification should benefit Plant Extract gathering for Tenno across the board. \nPlayers can now visit Cetus without having completed the Saya’s Vigil Quest.\nThis removes the requirement to play Saya’s Vigil to receive their Mote Amp from Onkko.\nAlso removed mention of Saya’s Vigil from the Once Awake quest completion Inbox as it is no longer a Main Story quest.\nAdded a slight delay (0.5 seconds) to the Bailiff’s charge attack. \nRemoved the intro settings screen for new players.\nThis was added with The Duviri Paradox, but is since outdated. We’re removing it so that players are encouraged to look at all available settings instead.\nPlayers who load into the game for the first time will now be presented with custom launcher music to improve the transition from launcher to the Awakening opening cinematic.\nThe introductory Kuva Lich inbox message will now only be delivered once players meet all prerequisites to engage with Kuva Liches (i.e. have completed The War Within and Rising Tide quests, and are Mastery Rank 5).\nPreviously this was sent only upon The War Within completion, as the other prerequisites were required to reach that Quest. \nUpdated the pop-up for newly-acquired Railjack Components to indicate where they can be inspected. \nNow reads: Inspect this recovered component in a Dry Dock (Clan Dojo or Saturn/Pluto Relay) to discover its statistics.\n\nAdded 10 new conversations to each of the original Hex members (Arthur, Aoi, Eleanor, Amir, Quincy, and Lettie).\nThese new conversations are available to players who have reached Loved or Best Friend status.\nPlayers now have the option to reset the Protoframes per “group” upon the 1999 Calendar New Year.\nWhen the 1999 Calendar resets, players will be presented the following options in their KIM window if they choose to Forget:\nForget The Hex (Arthur, Aoi, Eleanor, Amir, Quincy, and Lettie)\nForget The Roundtable (Flare, Kaya, Velimir & Minerva)\nForget All\nCaptura Changes\nAdded a Grid Lines (rule of thirds) toggle under the Camera settings!\nChanged the confirm button while editing camera setting on controllers to the right thumbstick due to the previous binding overlapping with Select Scene.\nCaptura Fixes\nFixed unintentional text inputs in Captura’s Select Scene search bar when accessed from the Captura Gearwheel.\nFixed Captura’s “Show UI In Screenshots” always hiding the player’s UI in screenshots, regardless of whether it’s toggled on or not.\nFixed changing Gear Wheel items in the Arsenal in Captura opening the Quick Access wheel instead.\nFixed removing the last camera or all camera positions instead advances time.\nFixed being able to spawn enemies specifically via the Captura Quick Access wheel in scenes where enemies aren’t allowed to be spawned (e.g., The Necralisk).\nThis restriction already existed with the original UI! However, the Quick Access Wheel was able to unintentionally bypass it.\nFixed selecting the “Spawn Enemies” option from the Captura Quick Access Wheel immediately moving the cursor into the enemy search field. \nFixed Depth of Field settings not working when used from the Captura Quick Access Wheel.\n(Missed note from Yareli Prime) Corrupted Holokeys are a guaranteed reward from Void Storm missions — players will earn 1 Corrupted Holokey from Void Storms, and an extra for Void Storms in the Veil Proxima (2 total). \nMade several improvements to the Helminth Feed UI to better communicate how the resources are being contributed. \nThe popup while hovering over a resource will now indicate what type of Secretion it is and how much of it will be fed. Also added a “select” button callout. \nSelected resources will now populate above the “Feed” button to show you what you have selected thus far. \nHovering over the resource icons will also tell you the percentage of secretion that will be achieved after feeding it to Helminth. \nYou can remove resources from the lineup of secretions by simply selecting the icon. \nIncarnon Adapters available in the current Steel Path Circuit rotation are now available for Platinum Purchase in Cavalero’s store in the Chrysalith.\nPurchasing these Incarnons for Platinum will reward players with both the Adapter and the required resources to install it. \nAdded Limbo’s Banish to the “Invert Tap/Hold Abilities” setting. \nYou can now separately customize Charge reticle colors via the HUD Customization screen. \nWe added this setting for Reload / Charge with Yareli Prime, but separated them out further after community feedback. Players can now customize Reload and Charge colors separately. \nImproved search term weighting so that item names have the highest priority —  this is especially helpful for items whose names commonly appear in item descriptions, like Mag.\nAdversary weapons with an Elemental Vice installed now have an Elemental Vice icon in the Arsenal/Inventory and in the on-hover tooltip.\nChanged default aim sensitivity to mirror the values more commonly used by players on KBM and controller.\nReduced default aim sensitivity values from 50% to 20%\nReduced aim sensitivity range min value from 0.1 to 0.01\nThese changes will not affect  your custom sensitivity settings. \nSorties now use the newly added Weapon class subcategories (Precision Rifle, Bow/Crossbow, etc) when indicating a specific Modifier.\nAdded the ability to search for specific input bindings in the Customize Key Bindings options instead of having to browse through manually.\nThe following settings have been grouped into corresponding sub-menus. Open the parent category to open these options:\nController Deadzone:\nLeft Stick Deadzone\nLeft Stick Axial Deadzone\nLeft Stick Maximum Input Threshold \nRight Stick Deadzone\nRight Stick Axial Deadzone\nRight Stick Maximum Input Threshold \nTrigger Press Threshold (Controller) \nTrigger Release Threshold (Controller) \nLegacy Aim Deadzone\nChat Visibility \nShow Region Chat\nShow Questions & Answers Chat\nShow Recruiting Chat\nShow Trade Chat\nShow Council Chat\nDamage Numbers\nShow Damage Numbers\nCompact Damage Numbers\nDamage Numbers Scale\nDamage Numbers Opacity \nBold Damage Numbers\nShow Damage Numbers for Non-Player Allies\nCharacter Highlighting  \nEnemy Highlighting\nEnemy Highlight Color\nEnemy Highlight Intensity \nAlly Highlights\nSelf Highlight\nAlly Highlight Color\nAlly Highlight Intensity \nPlayers no longer need to equip the Sacred Vessel to their Gear Wheel in the Sands of Inaros Quest.\nThe Upgrade Screen now displays your Endo count (instead of only appearing once you entered the Enhance pop-up when enhancing a Mod).\nAs we detailed in Devstream #188, we are making changes to Melee Slam Attacks so the damage now scales with the Slam’s height (ie. how far players were from the ground when they initiated the Slam). In their previous iteration, Melee Slams could be used in disruptive ways:  slams could be repeatedly performed with a large radius and no energy cost, allowing a very powerful attack to be spammed with no downsides.\nTo address these concerns, we have adjusted Melee Slam Attacks as follows:\nThe radius of Melee Slam now scales with how high a Warframe is before initiating the slam.\nWhen hitting an enemy precisely with a slam (by landing on or directly beside them), there should be no noticeable change even when starting near the ground.\nFixed how the Nira’s Mod set effect interacts with Slam for damage calculations.\nThis buff used to be incorrectly applied twice, once for Slam attacks and once for Melee attacks, and it applied to itself multiplicatively — meaning +100% took 500 damage to 2,000 damage!\nNira’s Mod set now only apply its bonus to Melee Slam Attacks.\nWe have changed it to be +150% (per Mod, there are 3 Mods so it can go to +450%), up from +100% per Mod (+300% max)\nReduced the visual effects of Melee Slam Attacks.\nThis should ensure that you can still see what is going on if someone in your party is slamming to kill everything that moves in Oraxia’s Lair (totally fair reaction, by the way).\nUnified the mesh and waypoint icon for in-world Arcane pickups.  \nPreviously, there were various different types of pickup meshes for in-world Arcane drops depending on its drop source. For example, the Techrot Safe would use the long stick-looking mesh, while the generic Mod mesh was used for Acolyctes, etc. Waypoints were also inconsistent in that some Arcanes had no waypoint or used a generic waypoint. \nNow, all dropped Arcanes use the same matching Arcane pickup mesh and Arcane waypoint! \nMade the following changes to Kaithes while in Durivi:\nPlayer momentum when playing as either Warframe or Drifter is better maintained upon summoning your Kaithe. \nAdded improved animations for mid-air Kaithe summoning to better maintain momentum.\nFixed Warframe’s fading in alongside the Kaithe when summoned.\nRogue Culverin’s explosions now deal Electricity Damage instead of the unintended Tau Damage. \nWe’re exploring adding Mandarin Voice Over to Warframe, starting with the Awakening and Vor’s Prize Quests. Players on the Simplified Chinese Client will automatically have Mandarin voice over enabled as part of this test.\nPlayers on the Simplified Chinese Client can swap between Mandarin and English Voice Over in the Audio Language settings of the launcher.\nFeral Kubrows no longer have red eyes when attempting to intimidate nearby players.\nSince update 38.6 removed their aggression, they no longer need to look so vicious when players get close. \nUpdated Boon’s skin shader! New skincare routine unlocked. \nMade improvements to the path following logic for most NPC units (enemies, Companions, etc.). \nMade improvements to NPCs to help them move on and off of elevators. \nAdded GI lighting to some of Citrine’s crystal projectors. \nArchwing Rush mission (Kepler, Phobos) now rewards 1500 Affinity for the destruction of a Transport Ship. \nMade improvements to water and snow displacement. \nMade improvements to throwing weapon animations to fix popping between mismatched poses and awkward head wobbling. \nAdded “Randomize Colors” and “Default Colors” options to Kahl and Beast Companion customization screens. \nIncreased Stalker’s tankiness in Duviri and in the Jade Shadows Quest to be on par with the Warframe Stat overhaul from Update 34 (Abyss of Dagath).\nSince the math applied to base stats was changed in U34, Stalker felt significantly squishier than Warframes in Duviri (and subsequently in Jade Shadows). We’ve updated his base stats so his in-mission values are as follows:\nHealth: 1554 (was 720)\nShield: 560 (was 300)\nArmor: 135 (was 125)\nNote: these changes only affect Playable Stalker. \nNyx’s Mind Control can no longer be cast on immortal enemies, notably those affected by Garuda’s Blood Altar.\nThis was leading to cases of Mind Control targets having obscene amounts of Bonus Damage —  over a billion percent, in certain situations. While big numbers are fun, sometimes they can in fact be too big. We've removed the ability to cast Mind Control on immortal targets to prevent further unintended interactions.\nReduced Tenet Envoy’s projectile explosion SFX when using multishot.\nUpdated some of the Orokin windows with a new PBR shader. \nChanged the “Hold to Fuse” binding callout text in the Mod Menu to “Hold to Enhance”.\nAs we have added quality of life changes to Mod upgrading, we’ve alternated between “Fuse” and “Enhance”. This change unifies the phrasing across the game to avoid confusion, as “Fuse” is a remnant of the old Fusion Core system.\nThis also fixes issues with the binding callout text not being unified across KBM and controller.  \nMade the following changes to Chroma’s Guardian Armor Augment Mod:\nBleedout Reduction Mods now apply multiplicatively instead of additively, so players can never hit 100% Bleedout Reduction.\nThis change also removes the 90% Bleedout Reduction cap, which was causing issues with Last Gasp.\nUpdated Burgerfest Peely Pix’s description to specify the healing amount for Allies and Defense targets, as they vary. \nNow reads: Enemies have a 5% / 10% / 15% chance of dropping Argon Burger Boxes that can be picked up to heal nearby allies by 10% and defense targets by 100. \nKill and damage done by Caliban’s Lethal Progeny Summons will now contribute towards the End of Mission stats.\n(Missed note from previous update) Made the following changes to the Zealoid Prelate/Bastion fight:\nZealoid Prelate/Bastion will now react properly to more weapon types/damage mechanics. \nThey were previously using outdated DPS thresholds which could make them very easy to kill with specific weapons that deal massive instantaneous damage (looking at you Kuva Hek). \nReduced Zeloid Prelate’s base Health from 11000 to 7500. \nMade the following changes to the Ambassador: \nIncreased damage on auto fire from 24 to 29. \nReduced ammo consumption of charged shot from 48 ammo to 16 ammo. \nFixed every charged shot from doing both Impact and Radial damage in a 6 meter radius. \nThis bug caused every shot to do roughly twice the damage over intended, so it was fixed to allow for the upgrades we made above!\nAdjusted dialogue volume of all Technocyte Coda members. Updated the Evolution I description for the Innodem, Keratinos, Praedos, Ruvox to specify a single Heavy Attack with x Combo multiplier is required instead of the previously written “Heavy Attacks”. \nAlso updated Sarofang’s Unique Trait description from “Heavy Attacks” to “Heavy Attack”. \nIncreased the Initial Combo from Evolution III Adept Reflexes perk from 15 to 20 for the Praedos and Ruvox. \nThe goal with the change was to ensure that the perk can provide at least a full 2x damage.\nMade performance improvements when volumetric fog is set to high.\nFixed performance issues caused by Gara’s Mass Vitrify. \nImproved performance issues when opening the Void Relic and Inventory menus. \nMade tiny optimizations to launcher checks when no updated content is needed.\nMade substantial memory optimizations to shader memory when using DirectX 11.\nMade systemic micro-optimizations to DirectX 11 rendering.\nMade small optimizations to memory footprint on all platforms.\nImproved performance issues caused by Undercroft portal VFX.\nImproved performance issues caused by Trauma Clamps in the Undercroft.\nMade system memory optimizations for PC and Xbox platforms\nImproved performance issues related to the End of Mission screen. \nFixed performance issues caused by Kuva Ogris’ explosion lights. \nMade optimizations to Nintendo Switch memory usage.\nFixed more cases of Quest spot-loading with a Dragon Key equipped. \nTook steps towards improving performance in Stage Defense missions. \nWe continue to investigate other ways in which we can address performance issues in Stage Defense — thank you Tenno! \nOptimized game startup, particularly first boot after installing. \nMade a tiny optimization in game load time.\nOptimized video loading in the Drifter Abilities and Railjack Intrinsics screens.  \nMade optimizations to weapon selection segments of the Awakening Quest.\nMade small optimizations to game startup time and memory footprint throughout the whole game. \nFixed a memory leak when opening the map with Oxylus' Scan Matter equipped. This was causing the game to freeze for extended periods of time.\n",

Dominus Thrax calls for aid —  the Kingdom of Duviri has been invaded by the Murmur, led by the newly resurfaced Major Neci Rusalka. Don the Hero of Duviri mantle once more as you face off against this new threat.\n\nWhile in the Isleweaver node, your Warframes take the spotlight. Select your loadout from the available equipment in Teshin’s Cave, and gain access to them immediately upon stepping foot into Duviri. While Dominus Thrax has graciously allowed your Warframe into his Kingdom, Companions and Gear Items remain unwelcome in his realm.\nAs Gear cannot be used, the Gear Wheel input can be used instead to summon your Kaithe!\n\nDuviri Objective\nDuviri Objective or Undercroft\nDuviri Objective or Undercroft\nDuviri Objective or Undercroft\nOraxia’s Lair\nDuviri Objective or Undercroft\nSummon The Fragmented\nIn lieu of the Orowyrm, face off against two of The Fragmented* at once to complete the Spiral.\nIsleweaver offers the following guaranteed rewards upon completion:\nScuttler Husks (16-20 on Normal Path, 20-24 on Steel Path)\nPathos Clamps (10 on Normal Path, 15 on Steel Path)\n5 Steel Essence (Steel Path Only)\nPlayers also receive items from Oraxia’s droptables, awarded upon opening the chest at the end of The Fragmented fight. Below is a list of key items that drop from Oraxia, but refer to the official Drop Tables Site for full details:\nOraxia main and Component Blueprints\nScyotid main and Component Blueprints\nSpinnerex main and Component Blueprints \nTemporal Dust (new resource) \nEnigma Gyrum\nSince this node mirrors The Lone Story, side objectives are not available to play. Keep on-mission, kiddo.\n*Note: The Fragmented in Duviri have a separate drop table from their Deimos counterparts, meaning the Cavia Arcanes will not be obtainable from this fight.\nThe rest of Duviri must be protected from Major Neci Rusalka’s hold. As such, The Triumph of Dust has been contained from the rest of the landscape. Players will be unable to journey to other parts of Duviri whilst playing the Isleweaver node.\nWhile you can’t explore the rest of Thrax’s Kingdom in Isleweaver, there is still much to uncover. Secrets are littered throughout Scholar’s Landing, tokens of Rusalka’s influence. A keen eye (or ear) can suss them out.\nEarned upon defeating The Fragmented at the end of the Isleweaver Spiral, Scuttler Husks can be exchanged for a variety of rewards.\nVisit Dominus Thrax and/or Acrithis to spend your Scuttler Husks on the following:\nOraxia’s Main and Component Blueprints\nScyotid’s Main and Component Blueprints (Thrown Secondary) \nSpinnerex’s Main and Component Blueprints (Whip Melee)\nThalys Incarnon Heavy Scythe Weapon Blueprint\nCaptura Scenes: \nDuviri Throne Room Scene\nOctopede Arena Scene\nScholar’s Landing Scene\nIsleweaver Cloud Islet Scene\nIsleweaver Drift Atoll Scene\nThe dust of decayed universes, rich in entropy. Entrati’s research postulates it as the animating agent of the nightmarish Murmur.\nTemporal Dust drops from The Murmur in the Isleweaver mission, and is a crafting component for new content introduced in this update.\n“Oraxia. The Scholar's pet. I heard the Usurper imitating his voice. The spider is her servant now.”\nSuccessfully taking down Oraxia and her Scuttlers will earn you Scuttler Husks* to redeem with Dominus Thrax and/or Acrithis in the Dormizone for Oraxia’s Blueprints, as well as Blueprints for her signature weapons — the Spinnerex Whip and Scyotid Secondary.\n*Note: Scuttler Husks are awarded upon completion of the Isleweaver Spiral, similar to Kullervo’s Bane.\n\nThe Unseeing Herald proclaims the will of the Indifference, uttering its twisted desires in Voidtongue. Who among us has heard its whispers?\nYou’ll encounter this new Murmur enemy in the Isleweaver Duviri node. Much like the other Murmur enemies in Scholar’s Landing, they drop Temporal Dust (a new resource used to craft Oraxia, her weapons, and the new Thalys Incarnon).\n\nJUNE 25TH @ 11:30am ET \nJULY 16TH @ 11:30pm ET\nWith the help of Dominus Thrax, venture back to Duviri and fight against new Murmur enemies to reach the depths of the island, but be warned of a deadly inhabitant — Oraxia — who stands in the way of your shot at holding back the Indifference.\n\nPlayers will start in the familiar cave of Duviri but with a visitor — Dominus Thrax himself! To expedite the swift removal of Rusalka from the Kingdom of Duviri, Thrax is allowing you use of your Warframes in Duviri without restriction! Pick your loadout for the fight ahead and head through the portal.\nYou will face a pre-selected set of objectives to progress through the island, including a faceoff with Oraxia. The objective types are randomized per run, but each will include a fight with Oraxia as the 5th to complete, and a final showdown with a familiar Murmur boss.\nDuviri Objective\nDuviri Objective or Undercroft\nDuviri Objective or Undercroft\nDuviri Objective or Undercroft\nOraxia’s Lair\nDuviri Objective or Undercroft\nSummon The Fragmented\nUnlike the main island in The Duviri Experience, you will not have access to side objectives.\n\nOnce a Signa has been unlocked, it becomes available for purchase from Dominus Thrax in the Dormizone.\nCommunity progress can be tracked in the Event tab in Navigation!\nWhile Rusalka hoards the throne, Dominus Thrax has taken refuge in the Dormizone (located to the immediate right once you pass the kitchen doors). As you fight towards reclaiming Scholar’s Landing, you can collect a variety of offerings from Thrax himself. He also offers rewards from previous Operations!\nSpend your Dominus Aureus on:\nNEW: Invictus Signas \nthere are three variants that unlock with community progress: \nInvictus Signa (30% community progress) \nInvictus Emergent Signa (60% community progress) \nInvictus Apex Signa (90% community progress) \nNEW: Phelonyx Parazon Skin\nNEW: Eight Claw Sigil\nNEW: Eight Claw Emblem\n5 Pathos Clamps (Purchase limit of 20 per player)\nKrios Signa\nProminence Wisp Totem\nFluctus Rahk Skin\nCeti Lacera Blueprint\nBasmu Blueprint\nStance Forma Blueprint\nThe Ballroom Simulacrum\nArcane Victory\nArcane Strike\nArcane Awakening\nArcane Guardian\nArcane Phantasm\nArcane Eruption\nArcane Agility\nArcane Acceleration\nArcane Trickery\nArcane Velocity\nArcane Precision\nArcane Pulse\nArcane Ultimatum\nArcane Aegis\nArcane Arachne\nArcane Rage\nArcane Fury\nArcane Avenger\nArcane Energize\nArcane Grace\nArcane Barrier\nNote: Compared to previous Operations, we have removed Common Arcanes from this redemption store. We have also reduced the number of purchasable Arcanes from 42 of each Arcane to 21 (essentially, one full Arcane instead of two full Arcanes). Additionally, Arcanes come in bundles! Legendary Arcanes are purchasable in bundles of 3, and Uncommon & Rare Arcanes are purchasable in bundles of 7.\nAfter Operation: Eight Claw has ended on July 16th @ 11:30 AM ET, Dominus Thrax will stick around until July 23rd and continue to sell his wares. After July 23rd, he will leave the Dormizone, taking his Operation-exclusive rewards with him. Acrithis, in her usual spot in the Dormizone, will remain as the permanent vendor for Scuttler Husks. Learn more about Scuttler Husks in the “New Resources” section above.\nThe amount of Dominus Aureus to spend to unlock each tier is as follows:\n\nAs usual, lowering your Clan tier is disabled now until the Operation concludes.\nShare your Feedback & Bug Reports on Operation Eight Claw in the dedicated Feedback Subforum.\nOnce Operation: Eight Claw has concluded, the Isleweaver node will remain intact in Duviri’s Navigation so players may return for Scuttler Husks, Pathos Clamps, Oraxia’s Blueprints and more. Read on to learn more!\n\nSinister grace interwoven with lethal versatility; the evolution of a perfect predator. Fear’s name is Oraxia.\nWall Latching grants Predator’s Lurk, rendering Oraxia invisible for 8s.\nLeap onto an enemy and pierce them with Oraxia’s spider legs, dealing Toxin Damage. Enemies defeated by this attack have a chance to drop Health or Energy Orbs.\nAbility 2: Webbed Embrace*\nOraxia throws a creeping web to ensnare her prey. Enemies caught within the widening radius are trapped inside a cocoon that increases their Damage Vulnerability.\n*This is Oraxia’s Helminth and Railjack ability.\nOraxia launches a barrage of stinging darts in front of her that applies Toxin Status Effect. Poisoned enemies spawn Scuttlers when killed.\nUnfurl Oraxia’s spider legs and go on the prowl. Oraxia is immune to Status Effects and has increased Maximum Health. Ranged Weapons are imbued with Toxin Damage. Killing enemies causes them to burst with Toxin.\nSilken Thread: Tap Dodge to leap to a targeted surface.\nA story straight out of Duviri, of course Oraxia has a Prex Card! I’m sure if you search Scholar’s Landing in the Isleweaver node you’ll be able to find it eventually. It’s a miracle it isn’t covered in cobwebs…\n\nWith the release of Oraxia, the maximum number of purchasable Loadout Slots has been increased from 29 to 30.\n\nThe Thalys played a ceremonial role in the Zariman harvest festival, and was intended to reap the first fruits of Tau. Now twisted from this purpose, it plants Void shards in enemy flesh instead. Each new seed planted causes existing shards to inflict damage on their hosts.\n\nEach lash of Oraxia’s whip injects its victim with a dose of deadly toxin. Upon death, afflicted enemies have a chance to burst, damaging nearby enemies and spreading the poison.\nGo on the hunt with Oraxia’s signature secondary. Fling a volley of toxin-laced barbs, or drop a cluster snare that scatters on impact, seizing nearby enemies and dragging them together.\nThe latest batch of TennoGen is here, created by Warframe community artists!\n\nAn Entrati-themed skin for Octavia, designed by blazingcobalt.\n\nAn Infested-themed skin for Hildryn, designed by Ventralhound.\nAn Entrati-themed Operator & Drifter Oculus, designed by Ventralhound.\n\nAn Entrati-themed Arca Plasmor Skin, designed by Apollo Phoenix.\nAn Entrati-themed Operator & Drifter Oculus, designed by Theriondrek & Vhynnz.\nFixed disconnected ground

from the “Fog Falling” atmospheric decoration appearing too dark.\n\nFixed weapon recoil being disabled by the screen shake setting.\nFixed cases of Coildrives in Orb Vallis Bounties getting stuck on the trap and not starting the objective.\nThe issue can still occur, but we’ve added a failsafe where the Objective will progress if the Coildrive hasn’t triggered the trap after ~30 seconds.\nFixed Kavats with the Sharpened Claws and Territorial Aggression precept attacking neutral or invisible targets, notably the newly neutral Feral Kubrows. \nAlso fixed the stagger attack from a Companion’s

We'll be closely monitoring reports and will disable this mechanic again if it is causing further issues.\nAlso fixed Archon Hunt squads being disbanded after each mission, instead of staying together until the third mission is complete as intended.\nPheroglands now have a unique waypoint in Legacyte Harvest missions.\nThese waypoints will appear for players within 25m as a way of highlighting this speed-up mechanic for Kalymos.\nUpdated Coda Bassocyst's unique trait description to explain the buff earned from Mercy Kills.\nNow reads: “Alternate Fire swarms enemies with mites, inflicting them with Impact and Magnetic Status Effects. If the targeted enemy is open to Mercy Kills perform a ranged finisher instead. Perform a Mercy Kill to gain +100% Damage and +100% Multishot.”\nAlso fixed Coda Bassocyst's Mercy Kill buff missing an icon and description in-mission.\nDisabled Ability use in the Legendary Rank 5 test as you don't need Abilities to hack.\nThis addresses players being able to use Perspicacity to auto-hack these consoles, which goes against the spirit of this test.\nReplaced a few more words in the Technocyte Coda name generator and made further refinements to the name generation system to avoid unfortunate name combinations.\nIncreased the grace window of Temple's metronome SFX from 4 to 7 Backbeat beats. \nAlso slightly increased the volume of the metronome SFX.\nIncreased the volume on SFX for the Techrot Cache and Techrot Cache key. \nAlso slightly increased the radius at which they can be heard.\nVarious Technocyte Coda animation fixes and polish.\nPolished various Technocyte Coda SFX.\nRefined the SFX mix for Gemini Skin voice lines to avoid unintended fluctuations in enemy sounds.\nFixed Baruuk’s Reactive Storm Augment transforming all Melee damage into the enemy’s weakness type, instead of just the base Impact Damage.\nRemoved a feature of Baruuk’s Reactive Storm Augment that tried to build towards the enemy faction weakness that you modded for.\nThe enemy weakness targeted will now be consistent regardless of Mods, prioritizing Combined Elemental Damage types, and never choosing a Physical Damage type.\nThis also fixes an issue where Impact Damage was always prioritized instead of Corrosive Damage when fighting Grineer and Scaldra.\nFixed Baruuk’s Reactive Storm Augment combining base Elemental weaknesses with modded base Elements.\n",

This mechanic wasn't entirely clear to players, so we've simplified it to mirror the Rogue Necramech Eximus mechanic in Deep Archimedea.\nIncreased the number of Backbeat beats that Temple's Metronome SFX will play for from 3 to 4.\nThis gives players a little more wiggle room to continue triggering the Metronome SFX when they're consistently casting Temple's abilities. \nAs a refresher, the SFX will play on the first successful Backbeat hit, and will continue to play until they have not cast an Ability on the Backbeat for 4 beats. \nOur original patch note indicated it persisted for 5 beats — this was incorrect, oops!\nFurther SFX polish for Temple's Abilities.\nIncreased the volume on Temple's Metronome.\n",

  "changes": "Techrot Encore: Hotfix 38.5.3:\nSteel Path and Arbitrations now only require players to have completed the Star Chart up until The New War to unlock these mission types. As a result, we have removed the requirement to complete the following nodes:\nZariman Ten Zero missions (those unlocked by the Angels of the Zariman Quest)\nAlbrecht's Laboratories missions (those unlocked by the Whispers in the Walls Quest)\nHöllvania missions (those unlocked by The Hex Quest)\nAfter a heart-to-heart with Kaya, her unintentional curse has been reinstituted with a Nova-minded version.\nIf we ever decide to drop an F-bomb in Warframe, it won't be by accident (unlike on our Devstreams). \nThe Mission Tutorial Transmissions toggle now applies to transmissions in Deep Archimedea and Temporal Archimedea missions.\nStage Defense Bounties will now indicate that Extraction is blocked if the bounty objective has not been met on the Leave/Continue screen.\nPreviously, Extraction was unavailable, but this restriction was not communicated to players, resulting in possible confusion as to why the Extract option was not working.\nImproved enemy pathing in the lower stage of Stage Defense missions.\nAlso updated the minimap in this lower stage to more accurately display the area accessible to the player.\nIncreased Coda Sporothix's magazine size from 9 to 11.\nRefined Temple's Ability SFX for allies to reduce audio fatigue.\nAdded metronome SFX to help players time their casts to Temple's Backbeat. \nThe Metronome SFX starts when you cast an Ability on the Backbeat and will play for 5 3 beats and turn off if you have stopped casting. We implemented it this way so Temple doesn’t have a metronome playing 100% of the time.\nYou can turn this off via the “Metronome Audio” setting in Temple's Abilities Menu.\nImproved SFX on Techrot Cache keys to make them easier to find.\nCrossfire missions now display the actual mission time in the Navigation screen.\nPreviously, the mission type was only revealed once selecting the node/Alert itself.\nRauta's unique trait now gives combo to your Exalted Melee if it's your Active Melee Weapon.\nMelee Crescendo specific changes:\nAsh's Bladestorm now benefits from Melee Crescendo!\nRemoved the ability to equip Melee Crescendo on Whipclaw, Shattered Lash, and Landslide Fists as they cannot perform Finishers.\nMelee Crescendo now only increases the initial Combo of a weapon on Finishers performed with the weapon to which Crescendo is applied.\nThe only exception to this rule is Parazon Finishers which will count towards all weapons on which Melee Crescendo equipped.\nChannelled Exalted Melee Weapons (ex: Exalted Blade) will still only be able to stack up Melee Crescendo while they are active.

  "additions": "Enemies feature their Health and Shields increased by 100% with an additional 50% per Squad member, up to 300%.\nEximus galore! Expect to see more Eximus units.\nJust like how The Hex join for Bounties, Velimir (the Frost Protoframe) and Minerva (the Saryn Protoframe) will join your Temporal Archimedea missions!\nMission 1: Velimir is present.\nMission 2: Minerva is present.\nMission 3: Both Velimir and Minerva are present.\nDetriments for you, and you alone. Like Deep Archimedea, these parameters are debuffs hindering your Ability to overpower the game mode. Additionally, the new Personal Modifiers have also found their way into Deep Archimedea!\nHellscrub demands players survive for 10 minutes in the streets of 1999.\nCapture 3 Legacytes, Tenno. Just like how it can appear in variations of the Bounty, you’ll be unable to extract until all three Legacytes are caught and consumed.\nPlayers must defend Temple and their concert for 6 waves.\nTempting time itself, Tenno?\nLike Elite Deep Archimedea, Elite Temporal Archimedea rewards courageous Tenno to earn even greater rewards as they take on the game mode at its most brutal state: increased enemy levels and an additional Risk Variable per level.\nFirst, complete Temporal Archimedea with 25 (or more) Research Points to unlock Elite Temporal Archimedea permanently. After that, you can toggle “Elite Temporal Archimedea” at the top centre of your screen.\n\nPlayers can earn three rewards and a Peely Pak per Temporal Archimedea run. With Elite Temporal Archimedea, players can earn up to five rewards, 2 Pix Chip packs and 1 Peely Pak.\nJust like Deep Archimedea, each Reward Pool only gives one reward upon completion each week, so the only way to increase your rewards is by increasing the Research Points. As a refresher, you can increase your earned Research Points by enabling additional Individual Parameters or Elite Archimedea (or by completing additional missions, if you were unable to make it through all 3 in your first go).\nResearch Points dictate the number of Reward Pools the player can pull from, depending on the player's Individual Parameters and Loadout.\nResearch Points do not stack, meaning each run has an individualized set of Research Points. Run all the Individual Parameters and win? You’re good for the week. Take off a few Parameters and only earn up to 25 Research Points? You’ll have to return later and amp up your modifiers for further rewards.\nCompleting all 3 missions of a Temporal Archimedea awards 3 Research Points, 1 per mission.\nCompleting all 3 missions of an Elite Temporal Archimedea awards 10 additional Research Points, for a total of 13.\nElite Temporal Archimedea is unlocked after completing a Temporal Archimedea with at least 25 Research Points, which requires players to complete Temporal Archimedea with all Individual Parameters enabled.\nEach Research Modifier adds an additional 1 Research Point per mission, for a maximum of 24 bonus Research Points earned by completing all 3 missions with every Individual Parameter enabled. \nThe maximum number of Research Points possible is 37 (13 from Elite Temporal Archimedea, 24 from Individual Parameters).\nAs stated earlier, the maximum amount of points players can earn is 37 Research Points for unlocking rewards. For a closer look at the drop rate of each reward pool and item, please consult the official Warframe drop table!\nThe Silver Rewards share their Reward Pool with the Netracells pool, so receiving Silver Packs is equivalent to finishing two Netracell runs!\nThe Reward Pool for the Silver rewards is:\nArcane Escapist\nArcane Hot Shot\nArcane Universal Fallout\nElemental Vice\nOmni Forma Blueprint\nCrimson Archon Shard\nAzure Archon Shard\nAmber Archon Shard\nTauforged Crimson Archon Shard\nTauforged Azure Archon Shard\nTauforged Amber Archon Shard\nPlayers will earn two Silver Reward pools at 5 and 10 Research Points! Therefore, the minimum to receive them is:\n5 Research Points: Finish 3 Temporal Archimedea missions with 1 Individual Parameter on.\n10 Research Points: Finish 3 Temporal Archimedea missions with 3 Individual Parameters or activate Elite Temporal Archimedea.\nCompleting up to 15 Research Points in your Temporal Archimedea run rewards a Peely Pix pack, granting you three Peely Pix stickers then and there!\n15 Research Points: Completing a Temporal Archimedea run with at least 4 Individual Parameters\nGold rewards share the same pool as Silver rewards, but with an increased chance of earning the rarest rewards, now including Emerald, Topaz and Violet Archon Shards!\nArcane Escapist\nArcane Hot Shot\nArcane Universal Fallout\nElemental Vice\nOmni Forma Blueprint\nCrimson Archon Shard\nAzure Archon Shard\nAmber Archon Shard\nTauforged Crimson Archon Shard\nTauforged Azure Archon Shard\nTauforged Amber Archon Shard\nEmerald Archon Shard\nTopaz Archon Shard\nViolet Archon Shard\nTauforged Emerald Archon Shard\nTauforged Topaz Archon Shard\nTauforged Violet Archon Shard\nGold rewards are available at 20 and 31 Research Points. The minimum, therefore, looks like:\n20 Research Points: Complete Temporal Archimedea with at least 6 Individual Parameters or Elite Temporal Archimedea with 2 Individual Parameters.\n31 Research Points: Complete Elite Temporal Archimedea with at least 6 Individual Parameters Active\nAt 28 and 37 Research Points, players can earn Pix Chip packs, granting 6 and 9 Pix Chips, respectively which players can turn into Peely Paks or other rewards in Kaya’s Wares.\n28 Research Points: Complete Elite Temporal Archimedea with at least 5 Individual Parameters active.\n37 Research Points: Complete Elite Temporal Archimedea with every single Individual Parameter active.\nLast, but certainly not least, Diamond rewards are earned when you achieve 34 Research Points!\n34 Research Points: Complete Elite Temporal Archimedea with 7 Individual Parameters active. Good luck, Tenno!\nDiamond Rewards are a guaranteed Tauforged Archon Shard or Arcane:\nArcane Escapist\nArcane Hot Shot\nArcane Universal Fallout\nOmni Forma Blueprint\nTauforged Crimson Archon Shard\nTauforged Azure Archon Shard\nTauforged Amber Archon Shard\nTauforged Emerald Archon Shard\nTauforged Topaz Archon Shard\nTauforged Violet Archon Shard\nWe’re looking forward to you getting your hands on Temporal Archimedea!

This test has a focus on hacking, but Ciphers are disabled. A true test of skill, the manual hack!\nTechrot Encore adds 18 new tiles for the Höllvania tileset! From new areas nestled in the underground up to streets you’ve never been down before, there are plenty of new corners to explore. \nAdded 153 new Höllvania themed Dojo Decorations! These range from traffic cones, neon signs, bus stops and so much more to bring a little bit of Höllvania home. \nThe glass windows, Scaldra tubes and electrical towers shown on Devstream 184 will be coming in a future update. Apologies Tenno, but we hope you enjoy all of the decorations in this update!\n\nAdded a custom Saryn Molt effect for Gemini Skins. \nThe default subsummable Molt effect was not working great on the Gemini Skins, so we gave it a totally new look when used with them!\n\nAdded Cloaked Appearance options in the Accessibility settings. This modifies how yourself and Allies appear while cloaked. This does not affect enemy perception, or the appearance of cloaked foes. \nYou can choose from the following options:\nStandard\nSemi-Cloak \nGlow-Cloak \nWarframes with cloaking Abilities (ex: Ivara) originally had these options available as Auxiliary attachments, which have now been removed. Since players can receive Invisibility from a variety of sources, we’ve decoupled this setting from the individual Auxiliary attachments and moved this to Accessibility settings to ensure it applies to all sources of Cloaking —  regardless of the Warframe used.  \nAdded a tooltip for Dual Toxocyst, Lesion, and Violet Archon Shards indicating that the added element will combine with Mods.\nAdded a pop-up when gifting TennoGen items to a Cross Platform Save account to indicate that it can only be used on eligible Console or Mobile platforms. \nIf a player has a Cross Platform Save account usable on both PC and a Console/Mobile platform, they can be gifted TennoGen from Console players, but cannot use it on PC due to our TennoGen Cross Platform Save policy. This wasn’t clear when Gifting them a TennoGen item, so this pop-up should make this restriction clear before the Gifter moves forward with the purchase. \nAlso added a message at the bottom of the Gift Inbox Message to indicate possible platform restrictions, so that these restrictions are also clear to the recipient. \nBelow the item itself, the message now reads “Your TennoGen gift is now available while playing on Consoles or Mobile!”.\nAdded a coffee mug decoration on the desk of Mynki’s Tribute in the Höllvania Central Mall.\nMany of the creations from our beloved Art Director, Michael “Mynki” Brennan, were fueled by a cup of coffee. Thank you for continuing to celebrate his legacy with us, and may your coffees always be warm.<3 \nAdded a toggle to hide equipped Mods while trading with another player.\nAdded Scaldra and Techrot Kills to Player Profile Combat Stats. \nAdded Screenshot binding (F6) callout to the General Controls setting. The purpose of this is to communicate which binding is used to screenshot, so that in the case where a player attempts to bind F6 to something else a warning will popup telling them so. The screenshot binding cannot be changed due to a technical limitation – but we wanted to improve visibility at the least! \nAdded a SpecialEffect Glyph in honor of all their wonderful contributions to the gaming community and to you Tenno for raising money to support their work! \nUse the code “SPECIALEFFECT” in the in-game Market or at warframe.com/promocode to claim.\n\nAdded a fancy FX to Mod slots when a Polarization has occurred. \nAdded Community Customizations for Styanax, Ember, Lavos, Ash, Mesa, and Nekros from Prime Time 419 and 428.\n",
  "changes": "\nThe Quick Access wheel now has all Protoframes grouped into the “Protoframe” category.\n\nThere are some new faces around town! The latest Protoframe arrivals not only have The Hex chatting but also… you! Visit the Pom-2 PC in your Base of Operations and hop into the KIM messaging system to start chatting with Flare, Minerva & Velimir (together in a group chat), and Kaya.\nDiscover what is haunting Flare and their sorrowful past. Learn more about the tumultuous history between Minerva and Velimir in their group chat as well as their relation to Major Neci Rusalka. Uncover why Kaya is desperate to escape and start fresh far far away from 1999.\nAccess to the Pom-2 PC by completing The Hex Quest \nConversations with Flare are available at Rank 4 (Hot & Fresh) with The Hex Syndicate\nConversations with Kaya and the group chat with Minerva and Velimir are available at Rank 5 (Pizza Party) with the Hex Syndicate\nNew The Hex group chat conversations will also be available after the first time you speak to each of the new Protoframes.\nHowever, unlike The Hex, they are not romanceable. The conversations will have you learning about these characters through the difficult and complex situations they have found themselves in. The narrative goal for you as the Drifter is to help them navigate these trials and mend what's been broken (if you so chose to go that route!). But it won’t be easy and will require you to choose your words carefully in order for them to gain trust with you. With that said, discussions may veer into sensitive topics like mental health, loss, grief, and more.\nSince the goal is not to romance, the Chemistry you earn is more about building rapport with these new Protoframes. If your answers bode well, the messages will have the same gold shimmery text to indicate that you are on the right path. Gifting items from the DirectGiftz Shop to these Protoframes will not increase your Chemistry Rank, as that is tied specifically to the romance system. But who doesn’t love a good Scooticle, right? For that same reason, these Protoframes will also not appear in Bounties.\nAs you progress through the conversations and gain rapport, their status with you will change. Unlike The Hex, these conversations occur in a set order, and your Rank will change as you progress through their story. Neutral\nFriendly\nLiked\nTrusted\nClose \nAssociate (if you didn’t succeed at helping them overcome their issue)\nBest Friends (if you succeed at helping them overcome their issue)\nYou can view your rank with them in their KIM Profiles. Their profiles will also update with notes as you continue to chat with them to help guide you on what the “correct” replies may be.\nThere will be a point in these conversations, where it’ll be clear you have either succeeded or failed in helping to resolve their issues. If you have made all the right choices to help them with their problems there will be certain “events” that occur to indicate that you have been successful in your endeavors. But there’s no fun in spoiling those surprises, so you’ll just have to play through to experience the fruits of your comradery and consulting!\nAdditional conversations are available by connecting with the new Protoframes on their birthdays! Their dates will appear in the 1999 Calendar at Rank 5 (Pizza Party) with The Hex Syndicate. While there is no need to gain Chemistry with these Protoframes, these messages serve as an additional way to connect with —  or antagonize —  these new characters.\nWhen the 1999 Calendar resets every month, choosing to forget or remember will also apply to the conversations you have with Kaya, Minerva & Velimir and Flare. For those interested in experiencing all of the possibilities in these new chats, choosing to Forget will reset all conversations (Hex included) back to square one. On that note, we’ve also added a new setting that allows all KIM conversations to play, learn more in General KIM Improvements (read on for details).\nThe Pom-2 now has the following settings that you can access by selecting the gear icon next to the power button in the bottom right:\n\n\nAfter three waves, Tenno will be presented with the option to extract or continue fighting. If they choose to continue the show, the stage will collapse into the underground for the encore performance.\nStage Defense is the go-to mission for obtaining Temple Warframe Blueprints, as well as Beating Heartstrings, which can be used to make purchases at Flare’s Memorabilia. In addition to normal mission rewards, Tenno will receive 1 Beating Heartstring per 3 waves (or 2 Beating Heartstrings on Steel Path). Since this is an endless mission mode, rewards follow an AABCAABC rotation. Stage Defense follows a similar reward structure to Legacyte Harvest, with each tier of reward (A, B, & C) all having a chance to reward any Blueprint, with later rotations providing a higher chance of receiving a Blueprint.\nTemple Blueprint & Component Blueprints\nRiot-848 Component Blueprints\nIn addition to rewards found in all rotations, each rotation also has their own relics and amount of Endo.\n600 Endo\nMeso Relics\n900 Endo\nNeo Relics\n1,200 Endo\nAxi Relics\nScaldra Screamers also have a few Arcanes stuffed in their pockets — you’ll find when you stop their shrieking that they end up dropping one! Each Scaldra Screamer will drop one of the following Arcanes:\nArcane Bellicose\nArcane Crepuscular\nArcane Camisado\nArcane Impetus\nArcane Truculence\nMelee Doughty\nPrimary Crux\nSecondary Enervate\nFor a full list of drop rates, visit the official Warframe drop tables.\n\nBlazing with glamor and armed with an Infested guitar, Lizzie, Temple’s power chords light the flames of revolution.\nPlay abilities in sync with the Backbeat metronome to invigorate ability effects while increasing Ability Efficiency by 50%.\nAbility 1 \nPyrotechnics*\nBlast targeted enemies with pillars of Heat Damage.\nBackbeat Timing: Ignite even more pillars.

While aimed, Lizzie blasts enemies with thunderous elemental sound waves, use ability controls to change the Elemental Damage type.\nBackbeat Timing: No Energy consumed.\nIt ain’t a pub if there’s not some kind of cards lying around the sticky floors. Head to The Round Table pub in the Höllvania Central Mall and see if you can find their Prex Card. Maybe they’ll sign it for you if you ask nicely?\n\nNever stop fighting, never run out of ammo. Temple’s signature machine pistol was modified by Albrecht Entrati to warp fired bullets back into the magazine when reloaded.\nThe standard issue personal Efervon projector, as sported by all ranks of Scaldra.\nPurchase Main Blueprint and Component Blueprints with The Hex standing in Minerva’s Covert Arms offerings (Rank 5 Pizza Party required). \nPurchase from the in-game Market.\nReap what the Techrot have sown with this vicious pair of Scaldra hand-scythes.\nPurchase Main Blueprint and Component Blueprints with The Hex standing in Minerva’s Covert Arms offerings (Rank 5 Pizza Party required). \nPurchase from the in-game Market.\nPerforate Techrot, and anyone else who stands in your way, with this Scaldra machine gun.

It has its grubby tentacles all over their beloved mixtapes and has mutated the band’s data and image into grotesque Techrot copies. Thwart its takeover by chasing down these phony-baloney On-lyne wannabees and be rewarded for doing so! Arthur Nightingale has kindly offered his guidance to you via transmissions to see that you are successful in eradicating the infection.\nCompleted all main Quests up to and including The Hex Quest \nYou need access to the Höllvania missions in order to participate in the Technocyte Coda system. \nNo active Kuva Lich or Sister of Parvos \nOnly 1 Adversary can be active at a time. If you have an active Adversary, you will not see Mixtapes in Höllvania missions that are the key to generating your Technocyte Coda. This however will not impact your squadmates ability to spawn their own if they do not have an active Adversary.\nFirst and foremost its important to note that all stages on the path to clearing your Technocyte Coda (aside from the final showdown in Earth Proxima) will specifically occur on the following Höllvania missions and Bounties:\nExterminate (Rhu Manor & Mausoleum East)\nHell-Scrub (Old Konderuk and Mischta Rampart) \nLegacyte Harvest (Köbinn West)\nThese missions will appear surrounded by green Techrot infection in the Pom-2 NavNow map screen. Technocyte Coda activity will never occur in the H-09 Efervon Tank Assassination, Solstice Square Defense and Faceoff (both Squad vs. Squad and Single Squad) missions to avoid disrupting mission objectives.\n\n\nYou will generate a Technocyte Coda regardless of if you fail or succeed the hack, but additional events will occur based on how you perform:\nLike any good band, they’ve got plenty of mixtapes to go around so each time you go to spawn a Technocyte Coda the Mixtape title will be randomized. Who wouldn’t want to jam out to “ButteryPenguine” and  “BizkitBounce”? Just to name a few!\nHARDDRIVE_ \nZEKE_\nDRILLBIT_\nPACKET_\nDJROM_\n\nThey’ll also be front and center in the Technocyte Coda screen! This screen will also indicate their weaknesses, resistances and immunities, rewards for defeating them, Malware Disinfection progress and Antivirus attempts – all of which we’ll cover in the following sections! You can access this screen at any time by selecting the Technocyte Coda button in the pause menu or by selecting the “Repair” button in the POM-2’s MALWARE FOUND popup.\n\nUnlike Kuva Liches and Sisters of Parvos, the progenitor Warframe (the Warframe you have equipped at the time of Adversary generation) does not have an impact on your Technocyte Coda. With Kuva Liches and Sisters of Parvos, this would determine the Valence Bonus of the Kuva/Tenet weapon you earn from Vanquishing them. But with the Technocyte Coda system, Coda Weapons are not directly acquired from the Coda themselves, but rather from Eleanor for a new special currency called Live Heartcells, rewarded from Vanquishing Technocyte Codas. More on that in the Technocyte Coda Rewards section.\nTechnocyte Coda Debuff: The Coda Cyst!\n\nThis juicy green boil protruding from the neck will grow bigger with each Höllvania mission completed while you have a Technocyte Coda active. Only defeating them will Disinfect your Warframes and rid them of that atrocious fashion killer!\nIt is possible to have both a Helminth and a Technocyte Cyst at the same time. You can still drain the Helminth Cyst in the Helminth chair as usual to remove it, but the Technocyte Cyst will remain until you defeat your Technocyte Coda.\nYou can view your Malware Disinfection progress in the Technocyte Coda screen.\n\n\nBefore taking on your Technocyte Coda in a Duet, you’ll first want to equip your Parazon with Antivirus Mods!\nUnlike Kuva Liches/Sisters of Parvos, failing to have the correct Antivirus Mod will not increase the strength of your Technocyte Coda. The only consequence for failing is not gaining Malware Disinfection.\n\nThere are a total of 8 Antivirus Mods, each a brand of 1999 Antivirus software:\n\nThere are a total of 5 Potency Mods:\nTo get you started, we suggest equipping Antivirus Mods into all three of the Parazon slots for higher chance of finding the correct one in Duet encounters. Once you have found it, you can swap out the two incorrect Antivirus Mods for whichever Potency Mods you like!\n\nEach of the Antivirus and Potency Mods have three charges. Once all three charges have been consumed, the mod becomes corrupted and will no longer provide its listed effects.\nAntivirus charges are only consumed once you have made the final injection to a Duet to bring Malware Disinfection to 100%. \nPotency charges are consumed when the correct Antivirus Mod is injected.\nSimilar to Requiem Mods, 4 corrupted Antivirus OR Potency Mods can be transmuted into a single fully charged Antivirus OR Potency Mod.\nOnce you have equipped your Parazon with Antivirus and Potency Mods you’ll be ready to take on a Technocyte Coda Duet to gain Malware Disinfection progress.\nThe POM-2 NavNow map will mark which nodes a Duet could occur in with green Techrot infection. As a reminder, these missions will always be Exterminate, Hell-Scrub and Legacyte Harvest. They can also spawn in Bounties with those mission types. Duets only appear once per mission if they spawn and when they do it’ll be towards the end of the mission.\nHovering over any of the infected nodes will show the probability of a Duet appearing.\n\nThis probability applies to all infected nodes and changes depending on the following conditions:\nUpon freshly acquiring a Technocyte Coda, all eligible nodes have a 25% chance for a Duet to spawn. \nEvery successful mission where they fail to spawn, the chance across all infected nodes increases by another 25%. \nThe spawn chance resets back to 25% across all infected nodes after a Duet spawns, regardless of whether you fail or succeed with the Antivirus injection. It will also reset if you fail the mission that the Duet spawns in. If they do not spawn after 3 missions, the 4th mission will have a 100% guaranteed Duet appearance. \nMission 1 \n25% \nMission 2 \n50% \nMission 3 \n75% \nMission 4 \n100%\nOnce you have completed a mission, the node will clear of the Technocyte Coda infection (it will no longer be marked by green tendrils), meaning a Duet will not spawn there. Continue to clear the remaining infected nodes until a Duet spawns. Eligible nodes will all be re-infected if either a Duet spawns and you successfully inject them with the correct Antivirus OR you clear all of the remaining eligible nodes.\nAs you can expect with a boyband, each member has a special set of skills that make them stand out from each other (and so that you can choose your bias of course)! You’ll have to endure each member’s unique set of attacks and abilities when encountered in a Duet.\nBe sure to take stock of their weaknesses, resistances and immunities in the Technocyte Coda screen in order to prepare your Loadout for Duets!\n\nOnce a Duet spawns, get ready for the dance off of your life! Damage the boyband members until you have independently drained both their health and downed each. Both members must be downed at the same time in order to stick ‘em with the Antivirus. You’ll have to be quick on your feet because once both have been taken down they won’t stay there forever and will recover after 30 seconds. Approach either one of the members once both downed and use the “Run Antivirus” context action to see if you have the correct Antivirus Mod equipped.\nUpon running the Antivirus, the Duet will boogie on out of the mission and a popup will occur informing you whether or not you had the correct one equipped. As a reminder, you can track your Antivirus attempts from the Technocyte Coda screen to help guide you to make changes to your Parazon.\nIn addition to gaining Malware Disinfection for injecting the correct Antivirus, you will also be rewarded with a random Hex Treasure.\nUnlike Kuva Liches/Sisters of Parvos, you will not gain Disinfection from your squad members injecting their Technocyte Coda in a Duet. You will however still receive the 5% for completing the mission or from injecting your own Duet.\nSimilar to other Adversaries, if both members in the Duet are downed three times without attempting to run the Antivirus, or all players are in bleedout or dead, they will leave the mission.\n\nOnce 100% Malware Disinfection has been achieved, your Technocyte Coda will flee to Earth Proxima. You’ll finally come face to face with the Technocyte Coda and put an end to their tour of torment. So fire up your Railjack, pursue them and be ready to have the party of your lifetime!\n\nThe Technocyte Coda aren’t going to make it easy for you to reach their big stage performance. Two gargantuan speakers sit outside of the stadium acting as the stadium’s security system. You’ll need to take them out in order to enter. However, approaching them will send the soundwaves through your Railjack that mucks up its instruments. You’ll be brought to a screeching halt, making you the perfect target for a Techrot onboarding. Defeat the invading enemies and find and destroy the Hive Infestation they’ve left blistering inside your ship to regain control.\nClearing the enemies and Hives will restore Pilot controls, enabling you to destroy the speaker with your Railjack Armaments and move onto the second speaker to repeat the same steps.\nOnce both speakers have been taken care of, you’ll be able to breach the stadium. You can either fly up to the stadium with your Archwing and use the context action to enter OR use the Railjack’s Archwing Slingshot and aim at the stadium for a big flashy rockstar entrance.\nProceed to the lobby where the Technocyte Coda will take note of your arrival and take the opportunity to taunt you. Once all your teammates have a meetup in the lobby, you’ll need to show the Technocyte Coda how you really feel about their insult lobbing by destroying the screens with the faces of On-lyne plastered on them. Doing so will grant you access to gather at the stadium doors and enter the arena. If playing in a squad, all players must meet up at the doors in order for the doors to open.\n3. Enter the Arena and Fight!\nEntering the arena and reaching the stage will kickoff the performance! The fight has four stages:\nDodge pyrotechnic, lightshow and speaker wave attacks while your Technocyte Coda performs. You’ll not only need to survive through their dazzling showmanship but also the onslaught of Techrot enemies entering the arena.\nIncreased Health\nIncreased Attack\nIncreased Casting Speed\nAfter surviving the light show, three bandmembers will step down from the stage to take you head on! Attack them until each member is downed. Every boyband needs an intermission, so they’ll take that opportunity to step back on stage to reset for Stage 3.\nOnce reset, you’ll need to survive another round of stage attacks (same process as in Stage 1).\nAfterwards all members, including your frontman, will jump down off the stage to face the music one last time. You’ll have to defeat each member other than the frontman first before you can make the final blow. The frontman will be vulnerable to damage but will continue to regenerate as long as the other bandmembers are alive.\nOnce you have successfully downed the backup crew you can then take down the frontman and use the “Purge Technocyte Coda” context action. From here you will decide the fate of your Technocyte Coda’s career: Vanquish OR Convert!\nSimilar to Kuva Lich/Sisters of Parvos, upon defeating your Technocyte Coda, you will be presented with the option to either Vanquish or Convert. Depending on what you chose, the rewards and outcomes will differ!\nYou can view what you’ll be rewarded depending on if you Vanquish and Convert from the Technocyte Coda screen at any time before the final showdown. We go into more details on the specifics of those rewards in the Technocyte Coda Rewards section.\nThe frontman of your Technocyte Coda becomes your ally! They operate the same as Converted Kuva Lich and Sisters of Parvos – Your frontman can be hired on as Railjack Crew, may spawn in to assist after being revived once in mission and can be called in via the On Call Crew Gear item to deploy them outside of Railjack missions. Converted Technocyte Coda frontmen can also be traded with other players – the receiving player will acquire their cosmetic rewards (i.e. the new Ephemeras or Dance Emotes).\n(Multiplayer) Encore!\nIf you are playing in a squad, you will be able to take down each of your Technocyte Codas one by one together. You’ll know whose Technocyte Coda you are fighting by their name, which is indicated in the Health bar and during the intro cutscene upon entering the arena. To defeat all squadmembers Codas, complete Stages 1 \n4 together until the player tied to that particular Technocyte Coda has Vanquished or Converted their frontman. After doing so, an “Encore!” context action at the front of the stage will appear for anyone in the squad to use to bring out the next player’s Technocyte Coda. Repeat until all squadmembers Codas have been defeated.\nAfter doing so, exit the stadium using the Esophage on stage and return to the Railjack. Use the Navigation to return to the Dry Dock. Once you have extracted from the mission, an inbox message will be waiting for you with your Technocyte Coda’s Rewards!\nEach Technocyte Coda will reward one item from each of the following two reward pools after Vanquishing/Converting. There are also Vanquished and Converted specific rewards (listed below the pools)!\nCoda Ephemeras\nTail Feather Ephemera  \nHeart-Throb Ephemera \nLovestruck Ephemera\nPins-N-Needles Ephemera\nEmbracer Ephemera\nSoul-Eye Ephemera\nLuv-Byte Ephemera \nHeart-Beat Ephemera\nTE_Asset_EphemeraVideo_1080p.mp4Unavailable\nCoda Dance Emotes\nHype Drop \nWindmill Shuffle\nThe Crisscross\nCan’t Touch This\nLone Ranger\nTechnocyte Coda Stadium Scene\nTE_Asset_DanceEmoteVideo_1080p.mp4Unavailable\n\nOn-lyne Floofs \nZeke Floof \nTechnocyte Zeke Floof \nDJ RoM Floof \nTechnocyte DJ RoM Floof \nPacket Floof \nTechnocyte Packet Floof \nDrillbit Floof \nTechnocyte Drillbit Floof \nHarddrive Floof \nTechnocyte Harddrive Floof\n\nOn-lyne Posters\nOn-lyne: The Classic Poster\nOn-lyne: Jump Party Poster\nOn-lyne: The Great Despair Album Poster\nOn-lyne: The Heartthrobs Poster\nOn-lyne: Friends 4 Eva Poster\nOn-lyne: Hearts Take Flight Poster\nOn-lyne: Rolling Out Poster\nOn-lyne: Only Looking Up Poster, Day\nOn-lyne: Only Looking Up Poster, Night\nOn-lyne: Reunion Tour Poster\nOn-lyne: Feeling Blue Poster\nOn-lyne: Yeah Yeah Baby Poster\nWield the Technocyte virus! Vanquish Technocyte Coda to earn Live Heartcells and trade them at Eleanor in the Höllvania Central Mall for Coda Weapons.\nSimilar to Kuva and Tenet Weapons, each weapon has a Valence Bonus, but they are randomly generated each time they rotate into Eleanor’s store instead of being impacted by the progenitor Warframe. Each time Eleanor’s Store rotates, these bonuses roll again to offer new possibilities!\nCoda Weapons also have a Max Rank of 40 with Overleveling (increase max rank by +2 with Forma up to 5 times). Mastery points are earned for each additional rank until 40 for a total of 4,000 Mastery.\nThey are also eligible for Valence Fusion! Fuse two of the same Coda Weapons for a higher Valence Bonus.\nWith launch, Batch A is the current list of Coda Weapon offerings. Batch B will rotate on Sunday, March 23 at 0:00 UTC.\nBatch A: \nCoda Catabolyst \nCoda Hema\nCoda Motovore \nCoda Mire \nCoda Pox \nCoda Sporothrix \nDual Coda Torxica \nBatch B: \nCoda Bassocyst \nCoda Caustacyst \nCoda Hirudo \nCoda Pathocyst \nCoda Synapse \nCoda Tysis\nAmplify shockwaves of devastating sound with this Technocyte Coda infested shotgun that hungers for blood, and desires nothing more than to feed upon its enemies. Alternative fire  at enemies not vulnerable to Mercy Kills to swarm them with infested mites, while firing at vulnerable ones will perform a ranged execution.\nWhen the magazine reaches empty and is manually reloaded, the Coda Catabolyst launches not one but three powerful grenades. Also has a higher Status Chance, Damage and Magazine Size.\nThe Coda Caustacyst scythe is a force to be reckoned with, the Technocyte virus honing it with improved Damage, Status Chance, and Critical Damage, as well as larger acid pools with longer duration.\nGet the job done right with a pair of spore flinging terror tools. Inflicts a spore that spreads to nearby enemies on death causing Cold Status Effect and increased vulnerability to damage, especially from the Torxica.\nThe Technocyte virus did nothing but increase the Hema’s thirst for blood. With increased Fire Rate, Magazine Size, Critical Chance, Critical Multiplier, Status Chance, and  Damage.\nRip and shred your enemies to pieces with the Technocyte Coda Hirudo. With improved Damage, Status Chance, and Critical Chance and Critical Multiplier.\nEnhanced by Technocyte mutations, the Coda Pathocyst comes with increased Damage, Critical Chance, Critical Multiplier and Status Chance. While in-flight or on contact with the enemy, it will occasionally spawn enhanced, enemy-seeking miasmites.\nThe Plague Year of 1999 will never be the same. With improved Critical Multiplier, Critical Chance and Status Chance, the Technocyte virus has turned the Coda Mire into a truly horrifying blade.\nDrive home the pain with this hammer evolved from a scooter assembly. The wheel shapeshifts and gains a unique buff to match whatever type of physical damage it has been modded for.\nThese festering, writhing, throwable projectiles of pus and gas have been improved with a greater Magazine Size, Critical Chance, Critical Multiplier, Status Chance, and Damage.\nFiring a nonstop stream of vile corrosive gastric juice, the Coda Synapse comes with increased Magazine size, Beam Length, Status Chance, Punch Through, and Damage.\nDelivers a virus-laden barb to its victim that continues to damage it before exploding. With increased Damage, Reload Speed, Magazine Size, Status Chance, and explosion radius.\nThe Technocyte virus has contorted this Tysis into a more lethal weapon. With increased Damage, Critical Chance, Critical Multiplier and Magazine Capacity.\n\nSince the Coda Weapon rotation schedule is set up the same as Ergo Glast, we wanted to address the concerns about limited access to desired Valence Bonuses per rotation that we’ve seen with Ergo. So we’ve introduced the Elemental Vice to give players the freedom to swap their Valence Bonus Damage Type without having to wait for the rotation that may or may not have what they are looking for.\nThe Damage Types that you can swap to are the same ones that your Adversary Weapon’s can generate:\nImpact\nElectricity \nHeat \nCold\nToxin\nMagnetic \nRadiation\nFor Standing at Rank 5 (Pizza Party) with The Hex Syndicate from Eleanor’s wares in the Höllvania Central Mall. \nAfter completing The Hex Quest you can purchase from the in-game Market for Platinum.\nSelect the Actions button in your weapon’s Upgrade screen \nSelect the Valence Override button \nThe icon will also show the current Elemental Damage Type selected!\nSelect the Damage Type you’d like to swap to\nRinse and repeat as desired!\nReturn to the Archimedea once more, Tenno. Embarking upon the streets of Höllvania, you’ll engage with this weekly challenge re-imagined —  featuring new mechanics, 1999 mission types, and a new power fantasy reward set.\nJust like Deep Archimedea, players must complete three missions in a row being able to change their loadouts. Rewards are based on the modifiers the player thrusts upon themselves, with riskier runs giving tubular rewards!\nCompleted The Hex Quest\nRank 5 (Pizza Party) with The Hex Syndicate\nLike Deep Archimedea, Temporal Archimedea will feature the most challenging, ferocious foes the Scaldra and Techrot have to throw at you.\nTemporal Archimedea: 350 \n375\nElite Temporal Archimedea: 475 \n500\nPlayers will not have an opportunity to change Loadouts in between missions! In other words, the Loadout you bring is the one you’ll use through all three missions. Prep carefully!\nJust like Necraloid, she’ll serve as the starting point for choosing your modifiers and equipment.\n\nAn important note: Temporal Archimedea requires 2 Search Pulses to unlock —  these are pulled from the same pool used by Netracells and Deep Archimedea! To ensure all Tenno can experience Temporal Archimedea on release, an extra 5 Search Pulses were added with the release of Techrot Encore, which expire with the weekly reset on Monday, March 24 @ 0:00 UTC. This means, however, that you can choose to run any variation of game mode sequence, such as Temporal Archimedea, Deep Archimedea, and one Netracell – or 1 Temporal Archimedea and 3 Netracells.\nOnce all your equipment is selected, Kaya will open a portal to the garage.\nDue to Temporal Archimedea being in Höllvania, the 1999 Calendar Overrides apply to this game mode as well!\nHere, unlock access to Temporal Archimedea, choose your Individual Parameters, inspect the necessary gear and choose your Peely Pix!\n\nTo increase your reward pool and alter the difficulty of Temporal Archimedea, players can enable Individual Parameters and equip any of the items listed in the Loadout Parameters at the top.\nDoing so will increase the Research Points earned from completing missions, which can unlock different Reward Pools. For a better understanding of all the rewards Temporal Archimedea has in store for you, read up on the “Research Points & Rewards” section!\nThis’ll begin your venture into Temporal Archimedea as Kaya opens a portal to the garage. Good luck, Tenno...\nIntroducing: Peely Pix! The best way to take your Temporal Archimedea attempts to the next level for the sweet, juicy rewards beckoning at the finish line.\n\nPeely Pix features art from the following community artists!\nNelosart\nbugbreach\nDarika\nFreyaloi\nDasterCreations\nHow do Peely Pix work?\nPeely Pix are unique buffs you can attach to each individual Temporal Archimedea mission. Only one Peely Pix can be applied to a mission, so you can select three stickers for the three different Temporal Archimedea missions. Additionally, Peely Pix are individually applied, meaning your stickers affect you alone.\nAdditionally, loaner weapons granted by Peely Pix have unique Mod setups per Peely Pix upgrade level.\nPeely Pix are obtained from Peely Pax, offering 5 random stickers per pack! You can obtain Peely Paks from Temporal Archimedia rewards, and from Kaya’s wares.\nEarning 15 Research Points in Temporal Archimedea (see: Research Points and Rewards) will grant the player a Peely Pak to open up.\nEach Peely Pak contains 5 Peely Pix.\nEach Peely Pak will contain a random set of Peely Pix, with protections in place to ensure each Peely Pix is different in every pack!\nReceiving duplicates once a Peely Pix is Chromatic will instead net you an extra Pix Chip.\nWhen you first activate Temporal Archimedea, you’ll receive one free Peely Pak to provide a few Peely Pix for your first run!\nPop open a Peely Pak to receive your goodies, presented in a style similar to Relic packs!\n\nPeely Pak\nVosfor Cache\nArcane Hotshot\nArcane Universal Fallout\nArcane Escapist\nDisplay \nPeely Pix\nFrom The Stars Somachord Tone\n\nEach Peely Pix has three upgrade levels, which will upgrade every time you acquire a duplicate of a Peely Pix sticker. All Peely Pix start at Normal effectiveness (50%), but can be increased to Sparkly (75%) and then Chromatic (100%) with the more duplicate Peely Pix you earn.\nPlayers will need 4 duplicate Peely Pix to upgrade from Normal to Sparkly, and 5 more to upgrade from Sparkly to Chromatic, totalling 10 Peely Pix to max out a sticker.\nEach Peely Pak will not contain duplicate stickers and receiving extra Peely Pix on already-Chromatic stickers will instead net you an extra Pix Chip.\nThe following Peely Pix values are at Chromatic (100%) effectiveness.\nPlayers can now purchase Market bundles for a discounted price if they already own some of the content within it. This change only applies to bundles that are purchased with Platinum.\n\nConsumables (Forma, Boosters, etc.) and tradeable content (Mods) are not counted in the bundle discount calculation, nor are bundle-exclusive Decorations.\nNot all bundles are eligible for discounts depending on their content. \nFor example, the 3 Forma bundle is ineligible due to it containing only consumable items.\nAdditionally, decoration-only bundles are not discountable through this system. Our reasoning is that many players purchase decoration-only bundles to get decorations in bulk, and we don’t want to inhibit that behaviour.\nThe cost reduction per owned item is in proportion to its value within the bundle.\nProrated pricing does not apply to Gifted bundles, but we will be exploring that option in a future iteration of this system.\nWith this update, we are experimenting with the new Temple and Gemini Skins Bundles having both their Platinum AND Premium (for real world currency) options on one page instead of two independent pages. As this is experimental, only a portion of players will see this one page two option setup for testing purposes. Selecting either one of the options will work exactly the same as if you were to purchase them on their separate pages. Prorated pricing will still apply to the Platinum Bundles in this one page setup.\n\nGyre crackles to life in this collection themed around archaic experimental technology. This collection includes (and can be individually purchased):\nGarb the electrical dancer in a form evoking the valves and cables of years past, when science was wild and dangerous.\nExperimental Vortengeist technology spawned many curious calibrators and dispersion probes.\nBrazontik Chest Plate\nBrazontik Shoulder Plates\nBrazontik Leg Plates\nAn alternative look for the Alternox, inspired by the Vortengeist Laboratories of old.\nGet back in the action with this collection of Gemini skins from Techrot Encore. These fully voiced and customizable skins are sure to have you hearing applause everywhere you go! Each skin can switch between Warframe and Protoframe appearances by activating the corresponding Gemini Emote.\nThis Collection Includes (and can be individually purchased):\n\nFlare, a revolutionary glam rock musician, brings a human face to the Temple Warframe.\nFlare’s makeup can be adjusted using the Attachments color channels:\nSecondary: Eyeshadow and cheek contour \nTertiary: Cheek, chin, brow bone and forehead blush \nAccent: Eyeliner and eyebrows\n\nMinerva Hendricks, former Libertarian military agent, brings a human face to the Saryn Warframe.\nMinerva’s makeup can be adjusted using the Attachments color channels:\nPrimary: Lipstick and eyelid eyeshadow\nSecondary: Eyeliner \nTertiary: Browbone and inner corner eyeshadow \nAccent: Inner corner and middle lid eyeshadow\n\nVelimir Volkov II, a former Libertarian agent, brings a human face to the Frost Warframe.\n\nKaya Velasco, a brilliant science student, brings a human face to the Nova Warframe.\nNever let the music be silenced with Temple.\nThis bundle includes (and can be individually purchased):\nBlazing with glamor and armed with an Infested guitar, Lizzie, Temple’s power chords light the flames of revolution.\nA spike-studded alternative helmet for the Temple Warframe.\nNever stop fighting, never run out of ammo. Temple’s signature machine pistol was modified by Albrecht Entrati to warp fired bullets back into the magazine when reloaded.\nEmbody the energy of the stars with Temple’s signature Signa.\nNote: We will be making adjustments to Signa position per Warframe in upcoming Hotfixes to address offset issues. For the time being you can still play around with the Y Offset slider to adjust to liking.\nTake style to shocking extremes with these glamorous shoulder pieces.\nGlam up your space with a miniature version of Temple’s signature guitar, Lizzie.

In Update 23 we introduced moddable Exalted weapons for six Warframes. Exalted Weapons are unique weapons summoned by a Warframe’s ability —  giving them access to an additional separately moddable weapon in the Arsenal. Exalted Weapons benefit both from its own equipped Mods and the Mods on the Warframe itself!\nIn addition to Exalted Weapons, certain Warframes Abilities summoned weapons that did not have the Exalted treatment (i.e. be separately moddable in the Arsenal), but received bonuses from other moddable sources: your equipped Melee weapon! These are what we call “Pseudo-Exalted” weapons.\nWith these changes, we want to officially make “Pseudo-Exalted” weapons into Exalted Weapons! This ensures parity with how players interact with summoned weapons on Warframes. For fans of affected Warframes (Ash, Atlas, Khora, and Gara), your Arsenal may look a little different to accommodate these new Exalted Weapons, but our hope is to keep the end-result relatively unchanged on the battlefield.\nBefore we go over what is happening to “Pseudo-Exalted” weapons, Exalted Weapons as a whole are getting some changes —  let’s dive into the three major adjustments shipping with Techrot Encore:\nArcane slots on Exalted Weapons.\nExilus Mod Slot on Primary & Secondary Exalted weapons.\nAcolyte, Amalgam, and Melee Combo Counter Mods enabled for Exalted Weapons.\nOur first major change is the addition of Arcane slots to all Exalted weapons!\n*While Garuda’s Talons are part of her passive ability, and therefore not an Exalted Weapon, we are adding an Arcane slot to them nonetheless!\n“Pseudo-Exalted” could achieve the effects of certain Arcanes on Exalted weapons by equipping them on corresponding regular weapons. With the changes above, these interactions have been removed.\nSpecific Warframes that benefitted from these effects will be receiving a new Exalted Weapon, which is outlined in the “New Exalted Weapons” section below!\nAdditionally, we have introduced Exilus slots to all Primary and Secondary Exalted weapons. This now matches functionality with existing melee Exalted weapons.\nNext, we are re-enabling mods that were previously disabled for Exalted Weapons. This means Acolyte, Amalgam and Melee Combo Counter mods can now be equipped on all Exalted weapons:\nPrimary:\nAmalgam Serration\nArgon Scope (Galvanized Scope)\nBladed Rounds\nCatalyzer Link\nSecondary:\nAmalgam Barrel Diffusion\nEmbedded Catalyzer\nHydraulic Crosshairs\nPressurized Magazine\nSharpened Bullets\nTargeting Subsystem\nMelee:\nAmalgam Organ Shatter\nBlood Rush\nBody Count\nDispatch Overdrive\nGladiator Rush\nMaiming Strike\nWeeping Wounds\nNote: If the Exalted weapon is unable to trigger the requirements for the mod, such as “when aiming”, “for Slide Attack” etc, you will not be able to equip that mod for that specific Exalted weapon. Example: Hydraulic Crosshairs on Mesa’s Regulators.\nAs mentioned above, we are adding new Exalted Weapons to the following Warframes:\nAtlas\nGara\nKhora\nAsh (more details in the Ash Changes section!)\nIf you own a max rank version of any of these four Warframes when the update is released, a max rank version of the corresponding Exalted weapon will be added to your account.\nWith their new Exalted status, these weapons are now separately Moddable and will benefit from Mods that were unavailable to them previously (namely Condition Overload, Melee Elementalist, and Smite Faction Mods). These new Exalted weapons will receive the same treatment as the changes mentioned above, and should function like all other Exalted Weapons — with a few exceptions we’ll go over below.\nNote: these new Exalted Weapons will not include an Exilus slot, as the relevant abilities can not perform Heavy Attacks,Tennokai, Parry or Block.\nAtlas:\nGara:\n*These are balancing adjustments for added strength with new Combo changes. More about this in the Ability Combo Counter Changes section below.\nKhora:\n*These are balancing adjustments for added strength with new Combo changes. More about this in the Ability Combo Counter Changes section below.\nSince Blade Storm, Landslide, Shattered Lash, and Whipclaw are not channelled Exalted Melee Weapons, we have devised a new Ability Combo System specific to these weapons, based off of Altas’ existing Combo mechanic. Recasting their respective Abilities within 5 seconds of the previous cast will grant you 20 combo points which will increase the Combo Multiplier by 1x.\nWe’ve also increased the Ability Combo Counter cap from 4x to 12x to align with the Melee Combo Counter — meaning subsequent casts can be buffed up to 12x the damage! By increasing your Ability Combo Counter, your Exalted Weapon will receive increased Damage based on the Ability Combo Multiplier.\nMods like Blood Rush, Weeping Wounds, and Body Count as well as Focus abilities like Naramon’s Power Spike now work with this new system.\nWe felt Ash needed a boost to compete with stronger choices. Below are changes that retain the core theme of Ash, but should help to bring him up to speed.\nTo start, there are no changes to Ash’s Passive ability.\nAbility 1: Shuriken:\nAbility 2: Smoke Screen:\nAbility 3: Teleport:\nThe ‘Fatal Teleport’ Augment is now a part of Teleport, and automatically performs finisher on cast with a 200% finisher bonus.\nThe “Fatal Teleport: Augment has now changed to “Quickend Teleport”:\nAbility 4: Blade Storm:\nAdditional Blade Storm changes include:\nAsh can mark targets with an increased radius around the reticle.\nBlade Storm now marks each target only once. Clones will no longer perform three Finisher attacks on enemies; instead, they will execute a single attack, allowing the ability to resolve faster.\nAs a result of the updated attack behavior, each attack will now grant 3 combo points — we also update the Rising Storm Augment to work with the new Ability Combo Counter system instead of the Melee Combo Counter.\nIf Ash joins Blade Storm through Teleport, you can now cancel it by jumping.\nReworked the Earth, Venus and Mars Star Chart node paths to help players reach The Second Dream Quest faster! \nCetus, Earth is no longer required to travel through in order to reach the Mars Junction. \nThe path from Earth to Mercury through Venus has been reduced from 4 nodes to 3 nodes.\nKiliken and Aphrodite were moved off the main path while Fossa was added into the main path.\nFossa, Venus (Assassination) has been moved into the required path for the Mercury Junction.\nThe path from Earth to Deimos through Mars has been reduced from 6 nodes to 3 nodes.\nHellas, Spear, Martialias, and Kadesh are no longer in the path, while Augustus has been added to the path.\nThe following Quest changes have also been made with the above goal in mind!\nMoved The Archwing Quest Junction requirement from Mars Junction to Saturn Junction. \nRemoved Ceres and Europa Junctions from the Natah Quest requirements. \nSaya’s Vigil Quest has been changed from a Main Quest to a Side Quest since players no longer need to travel through Cetus to reach Mars Junction. \nRemoved the requirement of owning a Necramech in order to start The New War Quest. Now, players who do not have their own will be lent a Voidrig Necramech for the duration of the Quest. \nPreviously, players would need to divert their attention away from Quests in order to farm and craft a Necramech. So we removed this requirement as it was disruptive to main story questline progression. Players can still work towards their own Necramech before or after The New War Quest at their discretion. \nChanged the stats of early Junction bosses to make them more difficult.\nEarth to Mars Junction boss (Loki) has had its base health doubled. \nVenus to Mercury Junction boss (Rhino) has had its armor increased, ranged damage increased, melee damage increased, and will be more accurate when firing.\nMars to Phobos Junction boss (Mag) now fires Kunai faster.\nMars to Ceres Junction boss (Trinity) base health has been increased.\nReduced Rhino’s crafting time from 72 hours to 24 hours.\nSince Rhino is one of the first Warframes players can earn in the Star Chart, he is getting a similar treatment to Koumei —  a reduced crafting time so that new players can familiarize themselves with the Foundry and enjoy their newly earned Warframe faster.\nThe Codex panel will now show an image of the next Quest available to the player. \nIf there are no Quests remaining, it will default to Leverian Prex Cards.  \nAdded an on-hover tooltip for Capacity Sources in the Upgrade screen as a way to teach players about Capacity and ways to increase it.\n\nAdditionally, a pop-up will now appear when attempting to equip a Mod above the item’s capacity. Depending on their level of investment with said item, this pop-up will explain Aura Mod, Stance Mod, Orokin Catalysts/Reactors, Ranks and Forma as a means to get the most out of your item’s Mod Capacity.\n\n\n\nConverted GI volume lighting and volumetric fog. \nRemade the color palette and applied new color grading to the Quest and its cinematics. \nRelit each level with GI volumes. \nRelit all the cutscenes, and the Warframe and Quest dioramas for a seamless transition into the Awakening Quest. \nMade several updates and fixes to the environment throughout the Awakening Quest (material improvements/PBR, added destructible plants, and more!) \nGrineer Forest nodes now use the day/night Plains of Eidolon/Cetus cycle. In other words, when it is day in the Plains, it is now day in the Grineer Forest. \nPreviously, these nodes had their own day/night cycle, which would change every 4 hours. This caused confusion with the Plains also being on earth but having a different cycle, especially for new players playing through Quests like The Silver Grove, which requires you to access plants that only appear in the day/night. \nNow, day in these nodes will last 100 minutes and night will last 50 minutes and rotate in line with the Plains of Eidolon.\nReworded the Time of Day indicator in the Star Chart for Plains of Eidolon to make it clearer if it’s Day or Night.\nNow reads: “[Current Time of Day] Ends in [Time]”\nThis change also applies to the on-hover node description for the Cambion Drift and Orb Vallis. \nUpdated Railjack component crafting costs in The Rising Tide Quest to remove components that are not easily found on the main path through the Star Chart:\nRailjack Cephalon Blueprint:\nRemoved Orokin Cell\nRailjack Fuselage:\nRemoved Cubic Diodes\nRailjack Propulsion Systems:\nRemoved Carbides\nRailjack Port Nacelle:\nRemoved Carbides\nRailjack Tail Section:\nRemoved Carbides\nRemoved Argon Crystal\nAdded 250 Cryotic\nRailjack Engine Cowling:\nRemoved Cubic Diodes \nPlayers will no longer be able to load into Junction missions until they’ve completed the full list of tasks to prevent confusion.\nCome-backs are coming back, Tenno! We’re implementing a few balance changes to create a fairer, less defeating experience in Faceoff.\nBoosts and Hindrances will now spawn more (or less) frequently depending on the state of the match. This is to help serve as both an escalation and catch-up mechanic.\nThe losing team, scaled by the difference between them and the winning team, will see more Boosts/Hindrances spawn near them.\nBy contrast, the winning team will see fewer pick-ups spawn near them.\n\nThe losing team is now awarded partial Conclave standing based on the percentage of the final objective being complete.\nIf a player leaves too many Squad VS Squad Matches, they’ll have to play against Squad VS AI to re-unlock VS Player again.\nBolstered Badguys gives 75% less Overguard to Techrot Babaus.\nAlly Specters will activate Boosts and Hindrances on their own.\nSpecters will activate pick-ups on both a timer and at random.\nThis does not consume pick-ups available for the player.\nSpecters will avoid certain Boosts that could potentially be frustrating for the players.\nLosing teams will see Specters more frequently activate pickups.\nImprovements towards Host Migration issues.\nFixed the player’s UI vanishing when swapping from Player vs. Player to Player vs. AI.\nAdded a new prompt to signify if a player has bestowed a Boost or inflicted a Hindrance.\nAdded a new prompt to signify if a player’s Boosts or Hindrance slot is full. \nAdded a new prompt to indicate which player on your team has activated certain Boosts/Hindrances.\nAdded a new prompt to remind the player to bind the Boost/Hindrance activate button.UI improvements towards transmissions from Aoi or Amir and certain messages.\nMade improvements to matchmaking to lower wait times.\n\n“Chemistry resets in Xh Xm” \nIndicating that you have reached your daily maximum of Chemistry earned and when it’ll be reset. \nAs a reminder, you can gain Chemistry once per day per Hex member via Bounties, resetting at 0:00 UTC daily. \nChanged the Raksa Kubrow’s Protect mod to restore it and your Warframe’s shields by 30% of its maximum shields and add its shield regeneration rate to your Warframe for 3 seconds. \nPreviously, the mod’s description was inaccurate to its real effect. It claimed to restore 300 shields but was actually restoring 300 plus your Warframe’s current shields. So if you had 300/1000 shields, Raksa would restore 600 shields, for a total of 900/1000. In instances where your shields were close to max, the majority of the shield restore ended up being wasted once the cap was hit. So we made the above changes to be more useful and lean more into Raksa’s shield focus. \nImproved enemy density in Netracells to keep spawn-rates high during the \"Reduce Security Level\" section.\nDisabled Air Support charges in The Fragmented One and H-09 Apex’s Steel Path fights. \nThese missions are intended to really challenge players and their loadouts. Calling in aid via Air Support could trivialize these fights (e.g. Kahl Beacon from Skaut drawing all aggro onto Kahl). \nThe Protoframe you’re dating will now lounge in different areas of your Backroom instead of standing in the same corner on the upper floor. \nPlayers must now complete the Bounty challenge in H-09 Efervon Tank Assassination Bounty before moving to the fight. This fixes a soft-lock issue occurring when a player triggered the fight before the squad had completed the Bounty, as well as players not being able to properly extract after the fight since the bounty conditions were not met. \nA “Complete the Bounty to proceed” pop-up will now occur when approaching the arena to notify players that they need to finish the Bounty challenge to proceed.\nIncreased the distance and angle at which players can open Lockers. This should make opening them much easier!\nMultiple Hell-Scrubbers can now be infected at one time in Hell-Scrubber missions. \nThe Venus Corpus Outpost tileset has received an updated Skybox!\n\nThis new Skybox features overall improved graphics and increased visual interest via the addition of Corpus architecture, dynamic landscape elements, and energy VFX.\nWe've also added multiple cloud layers and added a new sky that better fits the mood of this planet. \nEnemies outside the ring around a purged Exolizer will now be absorbed by the Exolizer provided you kill them when you’re within the ring.\nThis was a change we applied to Netracells and a specific Cambion Drift Bounty, so we’re adding it here too for consistency. \nScaldra units can now use terminals in Scaldra Exterminate and Scaldra Hell-Scrub missions to summon a paratrooper squadron, including a guaranteed Eximus enemy that drops a Thermian RPG.Techrot Cache improvements: \nIncreased Techrot Cache and Biocode spawns in larger tiles in Höllvania missions (most notably Exterminate).\nImproved spawning logic to prevent Techrot Caches from spawning in inaccessible locations. \nIncrease the Biocode’s SFX radius and reworked the sample to make it easier to find by listening for it. \nIncreased the Biocode’s pickup SFX volume to make it clear that you are holding one. \nKuva Liches and Sisters of Parvos will no longer spawn close to/on top of the Extraction area. \nThis is a change we implemented with Technocyte Coda that we applied to all other Adversaries because there was risk for accidental Extraction while fighting them, essentially forcibly removing players from being able to defeat them. \nImprove the responsiveness of the Atomicycle’s drifting maneuvers. \nAbilities that cloak Khora and your Companion will now also cloak Venari. \nKhora’s Spikes Auxiliary attachment can now be color customized!\nTechrot Encore brings a minor update to a few Captura features to provide convenience and accessibility! Our favorite picture-snapping niche is getting many much-desired tweaks between various UI, lighting, and save-setting options!\nAdded the ability to save and load all your current Captura settings into one save file.\nYou can do this by opening the Captura menu with your given binding and scrolling towards the bottom and selecting “Save Current Settings.”\nScene lighting and lighting rotation on Advanced Cameras (under Advanced Camera Controls) now interpolate between each other while they’re playing out.\nThis means saved Advanced Cameras with different scene lighting sliders will properly fade and transition said lighting settings when moving between each other.\nAdded toggles to Show Players, Show Companions, and Show Weapons.\nGone are the days of needing to equip a Synthesis Scanner to remove your equipped weapons, or having to change loadouts to avoid your eager Kubrow from getting in your shot! \nMoved the Lighting settings above the Text settings.\nFixed camera rotation not previewing properly when the snap function was enabled.\nPlayers can hide all Captura Menus with their default “Close” binding, instead of individually closing each menu.\nThe Advance Time input now functions on all Captura screens.\nThe Game Speed function is now a slider, moving from 0x to 5x speed\nPlayers can now disable Depth of Field, Grain, Bloom, and UI in Screenshots directly from the Captura menu, instead of having to go to the video settings menu. Any changed settings will revert once you leave Captura!\nAdded a Color Correction toggle to enable Captura filters.\nPlayers can preview filters by hovering over them with their cursor/pointer when enabled!\nAdded a Text Glow toggle to allow the player to decouple text from Captura lighting environments. \nAdded three additional fonts to Captura text functionality:\nAilerons\nFlareserif\nRoboto\nRe-designed Text controls for easier text manipulation\nPressing Reposition Text allows players to move and rotate text from the camera’s perspective instead of needing to keep clicking Reposition Text to move it.\nWe have simplified the Audio Options to make them clearer for new players and have also added Advanced Options for players to have greater control over their audio experience.\n\nA few of you are so good at collecting things that the Database hamsters are starting to express concern, and we've decided to take action sooner rather than later. There are limits on how much Data you can put in before it stops being based and instead starts spilling everywhere in the server room.\nThis is only a soft cap for your account, as you will still be able to exceed this by purchasing content like Prime Access and Supporter Packs, where the items specifically come with inventory slots to contain them. Items from Alerts, Quests, and Twitch/Steam Drop campaigns will also ignore the soft cap.\nThe new cap will apply to each of these categories separately:\nWarframes\nWeapons\nCompanions and their equipment\nVehicles\nNecramechs\nOperator Amps\nRailjack components and armaments\nThis does not affect the already existing limit of 210 slots for Riven Mods, or the already existing limit of 33 slots for Crew Members.\nWe want to stress that only a few players are anywhere near this limit, and we believe the cap is high enough that there's still plenty of room to grow. This is simply a precaution to reduce the likelihood of player accounts getting so large that it creates problems like not being able to login or update your account anymore.\nIf you run into any issues related to the Slot Capacity, our Support Team is here to assist! Please create a ticket if you require help.\nActive 1999 Calendar challenges will now popup at the start of Höllvania missions to remind players of the task. \nKahl-175 is now immune to Tau Status Effects during The New War Quest.\nBeast Companions and targets Mind Controlled by Nyx will now ignore most invulnerable enemies and not attack them. \nPlayers can now access Blink Pads and Hacking Consoles while on a K-Drive.\nIncreased the size of Titania’s flight capsule while in Razorwing to reduce the cases of her escaping the map.\nYou can now choose to either return to Orbiter or Cetus via the abort menu while playing Saya’s Visions missions. \nUpdated Featured Dojo icons in the Star Chart to indicate what place they won in the Dojo Showcase Contest (Bronze, Silver, or Gold).\nUpdated hand position of Warframe/Drifter/Operator when gesturing to a selected Planet in the Star Chart. This fixes issues with their wrists appearing contorted. \nAlso improved the animations while transitioning in and out of the Star Chart. \nMade some improvements on sun reflections so that they look more realistic on rougher materials.\nImproved the headlights on the Scaldra TI-92 so that they actually have light beams!\nMade improvements to the Contact Shadow toggle to reduce artifacting issues.  \nAdded a soft fade-in/out to the Arsenal UI popup in the POM-2 NavNow map screen. \nMade some improvements to Amir’s eyelashes. \nPlayers in post-Narmer Fortuna can trigger the “We All Lift Together” cinematic using this context action near Ruud Zuud.\n\nChanged the Pom-2 Calendar “To Do List Completed” message during Autumn to be about New Years Eve: “Another year comes to a close”. \nUpdated the tooltip for Tau Damage to be more accurate, now reads: “Tau increases Status Chance of all subsequent attacks by up to 100% with multiple stacks.” \nWhen Techrot Miasmites and Gallifex units die, their Heat damage will now burn nearby enemies.\nChanged the Crimson Branch Dojo Room's description to say “Adversary” instead of “Kuva Lich”. \nImproved the resolution of the Duviri Paradox Quest image in the Codex. \nMade the following tweaks to the Grineer Ballista: \nImproved their accuracy when firing and slightly increased their damage. \nThey no longer fire while moving. \nUpdated tooltip for Magnetic Status to communicate the bonus damage against Overguard.\nReduced the casting animation length of Volatile Parasite, Acidic Spittle and Endoparasitic Vector.\nRemoved the text \"and mods\" from the Elemental Sandstorm Augment Mod description.\nThis was misleading as the Augment only considered Damage Types, not other Modded values on your Melee weapon (like damage amount, critical chance, or attack speed).\nChanged the Lith S16 Relic to Lith S17 from Saryn’s Prime Resurgence offerings.\nChanged the Fusion confirmation popup to include the Endo and Credit cost to complete Fusion.\nUpdated Frost's Freeze VFX and textures to better indicate the ability's range.\nUpdated Frost’s Avalanche with improved textures, VFX on its shatter-explosion radius, and VFX timing on ability cast and shatter to better demonstrate the timing of Avalanche.\nUpdated the distortion VFX on the Corufell’s projectiles. \nImproved lighting on Frost’s VFX particles.\nVisually reduced the area VFX on Cyte-09’s Seek for other players in the squad to help prevent it from being distracting.\nAdded GI lighting on some of Yareli’s bubble VFX. \nUpdated the Techrot Babau’s Viral projectile ability VFX. \nUpdated the TV VFX emissions on the Techrot Obsolyte’s attacks.\nThis update brings optimizations to load times and VRAM usage in areas with GI lighting (Höllvania, Albrecht’s Laboratories, etc). However, to accomplish this some of the cached data has been reorganized. Normally the launcher will automatically prompt you to optimize your download cache, however, depending on when you last optimized, it may not feel it's necessary immediately and won't suggest it. In order to save approximately 8000 MB you can do so by going to the launcher settings and clicking on the “Optimize” button. \nMade a systemic micro-optimization to the script runtime.\nFixed using shift-windows-left/right to move Warframe between monitors not resizing the window when the borderless resolution changes.\nMade experimental systemic optimizations to the script system.\nMade experimental micro-optimizations to memory footprint.\nMade systemic micro-optimizations to level loading.\nMade small optimizations for low-end machines. \nReduced the number of enemies that can exist at once in Defense missions, so as to not overwhelm hosts on lower-end machines. Plenty of enemies will still spawn, but we have reduced how many can spawn at one time.\nImproved performance issues related to enemy spawning in Netracell, Faceoff, and Legacyte Harvest missions.\nMade minor performance improvements in one of the Höllvania tiles. \nFixes towards hitches that would occur when starting to load into a level. \nMade small optimizations to procedural level preprocessing. \nOptimized memory usage for highly decorated Dojos. \nMade systemic micro-optimizations to physics memory. \nFixed a hitch that would occur when updating a graphics setting. \nMade small optimizations to DirectX 12 rendering. \nFixed hitching when opening the Riven Cycle screen, hovering over the weapon preview and after cycling. \nFixed performance issues caused by VFX on the Zobov Shotgun Skin when picking up Cyte-09’s Resupply ammo. \nFixed performance issues caused by the VFX on the Cryotra (especially with Duplex Bond equipped.\nFixed memory leak with Mirage’s VFX.\nFixed hitching when opening Operator Equipment menus. \nMade performance optimizations to Orb Vallis raycasting meshes.\nOptimized DirectX 11 code, saving VRAM for older GPUs.\nOptimized some Railjack collision meshes.\nFixed hitch occurring when changing Operator/Drifter appearance while a transmission is playing. \nFixed hitch when loading Kuva Lich screen. \nFixed performance issues caused by Qorvex’s Chyrinka Pillars and Crucible Blast\nMade optimizations to DirectX 11 driver texture upload to slightly speed up loading times. \nOptimized collision volumes in many of the 1999 tilesets.\nFixed a bad hitch when accessing the Simulacrum Arsenal if the K-Drive or Atomicycle Summon was not equipped on your Gear Wheel.\nMade optimizations to the Table for Two stage in The New War Quest. \nImproved performance issues with Sporothrix, especially in conjunction with its Augment.\n",

  "changes": "Changes:\nImproved Void Tear spawn rates in Excavation Void Fissure missions if there is only one dig site active. \nPreviously, Void Tears (and the Reactant dropped from the enemies they spawned) would increase per number of dig sites. Since only 200 Cryotic (2 complete Digs) is required to open a Relic, this was counterintuitive as Tenno would prioritize one dig site at a time to ensure they received enough Reactant.\nNow, this Void Tear spawn rate increase applies when there is one dig site active, and we’ve increased the bonus to ensure there are Corrupted foes aplenty. \nReduced the speed of the Cedo Prime glaive from 105 m/s down to 75 m/s.\nWe wanted to increase the flight speed of Cedo Prime's alt fire, enabling it to hit more enemies and return to the gun faster so that it could be fired more often. This made the auto-homing feature have a harder time steering to hit enemies, and despite giving it a sharper turning radius to compensate, it still tended to sometimes bounce out of large groups of enemies.\nThe base Cedo glaive has a projectile speed of 60 m/s. Cedo Prime glaive had a speed of 105 m/s, and this hotfix brings it down to 75 m/s, hopefully striking a balance between the intention of more bounces quickly, and the ability to bounce multiple times the way a Cedo glaive is known to do!\nReduced the Ducat selling price of Nidus Prime Neuroptics to 65 as it will be available at an uncommon rarity with his upcoming Prime Resurgence Relics. Stay tuned for when you can expect that rotation!\n",

Now, with this enabled, you can toggle crouch simply by tapping the “Crouch, Slide, And Roll” binding. The “Toggle Crouch” binding is still available to bind to your controller if you wish to. \nAdded confirmation popups when deleting inbox messages that contain a fullscreen cinematic. \nWe want to prevent those who want to keep their NYE kiss cinematics from accidentally deleting them. \nAdded a \"Players waiting\" pop-up when players have approached the boss fight trigger in H-09 Efervon Tank Assassination.\nAdded the ability to exit out of the KIM reset at year-end if you're not quite ready to make a decision. \nBy delaying the decision you will be able to interact with the Pom-2 normally, but this reset pop-up will continue to appear each time you open the Pom-2 until you choose to Remember or Forget.\n",

Players can also purchase any item from the Rhino Heirloom Collection individually for Platinum via the in-game Market.\n\n\n\nRhino players can now apply Iron Skin Overrides via their Auxiliary Attachments.

Squad Faceoff node is no longer required to receive the 1999 Steel Path Emote and Trophies. Now, completing the Solo Squad node will register both nodes as cleared. \nCompleting the Squad Vs. Squad node hinged on matchmaking availability, which could be unreliable at times. So we removed it as a requirement to progressing/completing the 1999 Steel Path. \nThe new Faceoff game mode has received a polish pass, featuring the following changes:\nMade small improvements to Ally NPC spawning in Faceoff: Single Squad missions.\nThe number of ghostly enemy specters in Faceoff missions will now properly reflect how many enemies are on the other team.\nImproved cases of the Mobile Voice Pirate Radio jittering when moving around obstacles in Faceoff missions.\nFaceoff extraction will now become immediately available once one team completes the third objective.\nIncreased the amount of time required for the AI enemy team to complete Data Burn in Steel Path Faceoff: Single Squad.\nImproved Faceoff Assassination targets spawning logic to help eliminate cases of Assassination Targets either a) not spawning or b) spawning far away, resulting in one team being progression stopped. \nNow Assassination Targets should spawn in better locations overall and not clip with the environment.\nImproved VFX on the Gravity Wells spawned by the Gravity Wells Boost. \nReduced the maximum height needed to make progress on the “Kill X enemies while on high ground” Höllvania Bounty challenge. \nPlayers noted that it was rather difficult to make progress on this challenge in the underground portions of the tileset. This was due to the height distance requirement between players and enemies being far too extreme. Now, as long as the enemies' heads are shin’s length below your feet, killing them will progress the challenge, so it’s much more forgiving! \nAlso worth noting that players must have some contact with the environment to be considered “high ground” \nthis means that wall-latching counts! \nThe black portions of the Athletic Shirt and Sleeves can now be color customized! They now use the “Secondary Color” channel. \nIncreased the overall damage and Health of the Techrot faction. \nIn their previous state, the Techrot was easy to mow down in the Steel Path. So we brought them up closer to the Infested and Scaldra factions for more engaging combat. \nWe did not however increase the Health of the Techrot Babau. We want to maintain the changes we made in Hotfix 38.0.3 that reduced its Health and Shields. \nAlbrecht Laboratories and Höllvania resources can now be fed to Helminth for the following Secretions: \nOxides: \nEntrati Obols\nSynthetics: \nNecracoil \nExperimental Arc-Relay \nCalx: \nStela \nBile: \nVessel Capillaries \nEfervon Sample \nBiotics: \nHöllvania Pitchweave Fragment \nPheromones: \nTechrot Motherboard \nTechrot Chitin \nAn exclamation mark will now appear on the POM 2’s monitor when there is a notification available (Calendar Prize to claim, messages in KIM, etc.). \nCurtains in the Backroom can now be separately color customized. \nAccess this by opening up the pause menu and going to Equipment > Backroom > Backroom Appearance > Change Curtain color. \nMade tweaks to the cables in the Backroom ceiling so that they interact with surroundings better. Also adjusted thickness and color variation, optimized them and fixed them clipping into ceiling, beams and pipes. \nUpdated the Backroom Arsenal backdrop and fixed missing details.\nMade improvements to Drifter facial expressions during New Year’s Eve kiss cinematic. \nPlayers can now skip the New Year’s Eve kiss cinematic.\nRemoved the \"Tactician\" listing from the Alliance Permissions screen, as being able to deploy and manage Solar Rails was removed many years ago. Better late than never!\nRemoved the mention of “Status” in the Static Buildup Override’s description, since it grants Electricity Damage and not Status. \nNow reads: Each meter traveled grants Electricity Damage. Attacking consumes 10% of the accumulated charge. \nProtoframes will now offer unplayed \"Close\" conversations when players have reached Best Friend or Loved status.\nThis was a highly requested feature, since Protoframes did not have conversations available once you have maxed out their Chemistry. It’s possible that some of these newly-available conversations won’t fully make sense in the context of your relationship status with them, but a chat is still a chat.\n\nAdded SFX to the animations when activating/closing the Foundry, Arcane, and Atomicycle segments in the Backroom. \nTweaked the audio of Dante’s abilities to reduce the harshness of some frequencies. \nSlightly reduced the SFX volume of the Dual Decurions (base and Prisma). \nReduced the Techrot Babau’s spawn SFX volume. \nAdjusted mix for all Melee “whoosh” SFX. \nReduced the spamming of creaking SFX on the automobiles in Höllvania.  \nMade the Legacyte’s jumping SFX more audible from farther distances. \nUpdated the SFX of the propeller on the Hell-Scrub towers.  \nRemoved repetitive elements of Techrot Skuzzi's SFX to reduce sound fatigue.\n\nMade small physics memory optimizations. \nFixed Excalibur Umbra causing hitches at the start of the “Search for Umbra” and “Pursue Umbra” stages of The Sacrifice Quest. \nFixed Clients experiencing performance issues from Nekros’ Shadows of the Dead with Arcane Camisado. \nFixed hitches caused by transmissions in Steel Path Höllvania missions if started from the POM-2 in the Höllvania Central Mall.\nFixed a hitch at mission start in The Sacrifice Quest when searching for Umbra.\nFixed a hitch when viewing the Chains of Harrow or Glast Gambit quests in the Codex after having completed them.\n",

(Similar to Mesa’s Peacemaker, Hildryn’s Balefire Charger, Ivara’s Artemis Bow, etc.)\nFixed Dera Incarnon's \"Crimson Overture\" Evolution applying to your equipped sSecondary weapon as well.\nFixed Primary Exhilarate not triggering from Impact Status Effect that originate from Nagantaka and Scourge. \nFixed the “Fire Manual Trigger Weapons Continuously\" toggle turning the Mandonel’s charged shot into rapid-fire. \nFixed the Batch Remove Friends tool not working and giving a “Given Username does not exist” error. \nFixed the Central Mall Backroom Captura Scene missing the player-placed decorations in their Backroom. \nFixed being able to bypass the starting barrier in Faceoff missions using Wisp’s Wil-O-Wisp. \nFixed Host migration in Ascension missions before the elevator reaches the top causing returning players to be unable to complete the mission. \nFixed Unairu and Naramon Abilities being swapped in the Loadout overview in the Navigation menu.\nFixed Incarnon Reticle persisting in Free Camera View in Captura.\nFixed rare case where Quincy would stop following players in Hell-Scrub Bounties. \nFixed Drifter appearing blurry when customizing them via the mirror in the Backroom if Depth of Field is enabled.\nFixed player and Railjack crew being misaligned when in the Railjack Pilot / Front Gunner seat. \nFixed Clients being unable to pass through the gates of one of the secret rooms in Albrecht’s Laboratory.  \nFixed doors to extraction zones in Open Landscapes not opening while riding Atomicycle. \nNow, upon approaching the doors you will be auto-dismounted from the Atomicycle in order to enter and extract. \nFixed being able to purchase and place several “one per account” Decorations (i.e. Yooka Floof, Rell’s Donda, Nihil’s Oublilette) in the Backroom. \nFixed players being able to see friend requests from those on their Ignore lists. \nThese requests are auto-declined if a player is on your Ignore list, but this didn't happen until the receiving player logged out — resulting in cases where they could see a request from a player they were ignoring if received whilst online. Now it should properly auto-decline immediately and the recipient is none the wiser. \nFixed being able to infuse a second damage-boosting Ability on Warframes via Helminth.\nAccounts with Warframes in this state have had the unintended Ability Infusion removed.  \nFixed certain Decorations in Bird 3’s Shiny Treasures offerings not having the same appearance frequency as others. Now, all decorations should have an equal chance of rotating in. \nFixed the Noble Opal Collection in the Market missing Zaw and Kitgun Rivens.\nThis fix was patched live on January 16 and a script was run for those missing the Rivens.\nFixed inventory count not updating for Ayatan Sculpture placed in the Personal Quarters Vignette that are returned to inventory after changing Vignette.\nFixed Deacon statues being invisible during the “Use Deacon Veils to Open the Barrier” section of the Archon Hunt. \nFixed dropping and immediately picking up the Power Cell Detonation over the Grav Conveyor causing the Raptor Asssassination mission from progressing. Also fixed the timer displaying 9999. \nFixed Transference being enabled in the 1999 Demo. \nFixed a Decree Fragment spawning out of bounds and being inaccessible in the Dax Camp Circuit tile. \nFixed new players receiving event specific inbox messages (ex: Razorback Armada) before they have completed the Vor’s Prize Quest. \nFixed an unintended \"Infested\" category appearing in the \"Relinquish Adversaries\" Codex menu. There's clearly no reason for that category to exist — pay no attention to the boyband behind the curtain.\nFixed cases of KIM message history being cut off when swapping between conversations of different lengths.\nFixed various lighting issues in Cambion Drift caves.\nFixed Adversary transmissions not occurring in the Backroom. \nThese transmissions are still restricted during The Hex Quest. \nFixed cursor being visible during the New Year’s Eve kiss cinematic. \nFixed camera panning to the Fast Travel location when using the Fast Travel options via the Pause Menu in the Orbiter. \nIt should now fade to black and transport you like Gear Wheel fast travel options. Hey, you. You're finally awake.\nFixed Clients being able to “steal\" the Host's Atomicycle when loading into Höllvania missions via the Mall.\nFixed Eleanor missing her face if players Fast Travelled to her immediately after loading into Höllvania Central Mall.\nFixed instances where waypoint pathing could break in one of the tiles in the Orokin Tower tileset. \nFixed a case of broken waypoint pathing in the Grineer Sealab Tileset.\nFixed Clients seeing “Use Zipline” context action when they are not near a zipline in the Höllvania tileset. \nFixed certain areas of the Höllvania tileset disappearing when viewing at a distance. \nFixed Operator Ephemera’s missing most of their color channels in the Orbiter. \nFixed Operator face being stretched downward while sitting in the Transference chair. \nFixed combat music fading while fighting the Legacyte in Legacyte Harvest missions.\nFixed the Focus “Upgrade Available” notification not doing anything when selected in the Backroom. \nFixed an invisible volume blocking the tunnel between the Backroom and the Höllvania Central Mall. \nFixed rare instances where enemies would not spawn after joining an in-progress Höllvania mission. \nFixed loss of function when opening the Pause Menu while dismounting a Scaldra rampart in 1999 missions.\nFixed being unable to apply a Look Links chat filter via the callout button on controllers.\nFixed Companion DNA Helix VFX lingering in the Backroom’s Incubator. \nFixed the smoke VFX on the back of the Nezha’s Empyrean Skin taking Energy color. \nFixed unintended green texture on Senta Turrets in the Orb Vallis.\nFixed the Mods Segment in the Backroom having aliasing issues with an emissive detail. It’s been removed to save your eyes!\nFixed Titania’s Diwata having a second set of Damage stats in the UI. \nFixed rare case where Dante’s Dark Verse SFX would overlap when used in tandem with Titania’s Razorwing. \nFixed Amir Gemini Skin’s voicelines after Transference being robotic. \nFixed physics reactions missing for various objects in the Höllvania tileset (ex: firing at snow not showing hit effect). \nFixed the Community Tennobaum Aoi Glyph description being incorrect. \nNow reads: “A Glyph depicting Aoi levitating snowballs, created by alcyonsa.” \nFixed several text missing localization (ex: “Profile” in the KIM chat system). \nFixed a hole in the Backroom that players could fall through. \nFixed a hole in the underground Höllvania tileset that players could fall through. \nFixed not all maps being available in Cephalon Capture map rotation for Conclave. (This only applied to matches not hosted on Dedicated Servers)\nRemoved the \"Tactician\" listing from the Alliance Permissions screen, as being able to deploy and manage Solar Rails was removed many years ago. Better late than never!\nFixed players having access to a \"TennoCon\" controller icon set, resulting in white squares appearing instead of the proper button icons.\nFixed accessing the Parazon Upgrade screen from the Adversary menu then opening the Archon Shard menu resulting in your Lich/Sister of Parvos overlapping in the Archon Shard menu.

It is now enabled by default as intended.\nKnown issue: Manually disabling this setting will cause the same issue to occur. \nFixed Prime Laser Rifle having a wide spread on its first volley after moving.\nThis was due to a bug with its AI, which lent to the wildly inaccurate aiming when targeting enemies.\nFixed Kubrow fur disappearing if they didn’t have armor equipped. \nFixed Nidus’ Mutation Stack gauge showing that a stack has been gained at the halfway mark (UI-only issue, stacks were still being gained correctly). \nFixed Keratinos missing a HUD buff icon when its Unique Trait is triggered. \nFixed the Elusive Posture mod preventing Beast Companions with the Scavenge mod from unlocking lockers when enemies are nearby. \nFixed Arthur awkwardly pausing during the fade to black at the end of the Warframe: 1999 Demo. \nFixed several Warframe & Operator/Drifter Skins having noticeable gaps in certain cloth areas (notably Valkyr’s Carnivex jacket, Hydroid’s Rakkam Helmet tail, Frost Harka’s skirt, Revenant Mephisto’s skirt, and so on). \nFixed a soft lock that could occur if the “Skip Cinematic?” popup appeared during a loading screen.  \nFixed typo in Skana’s Incarnon Evolution I description. \nFixed PH tag in the “Offerings Given” mission stat for Saya’s Visions. \nFixed script error caused by Stalker Specter dying while casting Pull. \nFixed script error caused by casting Wormhole when mounting K-Drive. \nFixed script error caused by projectiles traveling through Nova’s Wormhole. \nFixed script error caused by Caliban’s Conculysts using Fusion Strike. \nFixed script error when quitting the game/logging out while the Star Char UI is on screen.\nFixed a crash in the Warframe: 1999 Demo.\nFor list of known issues for Koumei & the Five Fates that require future code changes and cannot be addressed in a Hotfix, visit our dedicated thread: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1414761-known-issues-koumei-the-five-fates/\n\n",

  "changes": "Increased the max number of Koumei’s Kumihimo threads from 24 to 30. \nWe also fixed an issue where the number of threads was impacted by frame rate – playing at a low frame rate would spawn fewer threads than intended. \nElemental Damage from “The Virtues” Blessing (Saya’s Visions), Smoldering Strike Decree, and Synthel’s Outburst Decree will now be added parallel to your weapon’s Elemental Damage, instead of creating Combined Elemental Damage types. \nPreviously, if your weapon had (for example) Cold Damage and the Smoldering Strike Decree was active (Melee attacks are imbued with Heat Damage), the damages would combine and change to Blast. For those with specific kinds of Arcanes and other conditional Elemental Damage triggers, this was not always desirable as it could impact build synergies. So we’ve changed them to no longer combine and instead live independently from each other. We may apply this change elsewhere in the future where applicable. \nNote: Damage values have not been impacted with this change! \nChanged the Junction UI to make it clearer if you had not completed a Junction task. \nThe checkmarks in their previous state caused confusion with players, making it appear as if they had completed a task when they in fact had not.\nChanged Caliban’s Sentient Wrath ability description to replace “lifted” with “raised” (since “Lifted” is a specific Status Effect).\n",

We greatly appreciate our day 1 supporters and thoroughly enjoy seeing them continue to sport their Founders gear. If you still can’t access your Founders items from your Cross Platform accounts after this Hotfix, please submit a ticket to support.warframe.com. \nNote: The Excalibur Prime Dark and Bright Glyphs are not accessible at the moment, but we will have a follow up fix to ensure they are in the near future!\nFixed the PlayStation-exclusive Obsidian Syandana being visible and equippable from the Drifter Clothing menu on other Platforms via Cross Platform Save. \nTo learn more about Cross Platform Save exclusions (including platform-exclusive items such as the Obsidian Syandana), visit the Cross Platform Save information post. \nFixed players who linked their iOS account for Cross Platform Save not receiving the iOS Pre-Order / Day 1 Rewards (Bombyx Syandana and 3-Day Affinity Booster) in their Cross Platform Save accounts.\nFor affected accounts, an inbox message containing the rewards will be delivered after downloading this Hotfix and logging in.\nLowered the Akbolto’s Mastery Rank requirement from 9 to 8. \nThe Akbolto is a manufacturing requirement for the Akjagara, which is a Mastery Rank 8 weapon, so we reduced it so that players can craft the Akjagara without having to reach Mastery Rank 9.\n",

  "changes": "Whispers In The Walls: Gauss Prime: Hotfix 35.0.9:\n\nLeave your enemies in the dust with Gauss Prime, now entering Prime Access!\n\n\n*This round of Prime Accessories features bonus items of the Blazargaze Prime Alt Helmet, Gauss Prime Noggle, and Gauss Prime Floof! These items are limited to the Prime Accessories Pack (including the Complete Pack) but will be offered in his future Prime Resurgence rotation.\nNow that Gauss Prime Access is available, the following items have been added to the Prime Vault for a future Prime Resurgence rotation. If you have Relics that contain these items they will remain in your Inventory.\nGaruda Prime\nNagantaka Prime\nCorvas Prime\nRank 4 = 2 Aya\nRank 5 = 3 Aya\nThis change reduces the amount of time spent acquiring and crafting specific Prime parts to rank up in a Syndicate, and offers players additional uses for their Aya. Since Aya drops from many sources, reaching those higher ranks is now much more accessible as it is no longer wholly tied to Relic RNG.\nRemoved the ability for enemies to deal critical hits to players, Defense targets, Extractors, Rescue targets, and all other friendly targets. \nIn most cases, enemies equipped with “player” weapons (Grineer Ballista using the Vulkar for example) could land critical hits due to those weapons using the same crit setup as their player counterpart. With a lack of feedback to inform players as to why or how sudden damage spikes were occurring, these enemies could easily jeopardize a mission. Additionally, while it makes sense to reward players for landing critical headshots, whether an enemy hits a head or not is outside of player control \nwhich ultimately made countering it near impossible. So, in an effort to provide more consistent and predictable damage output from enemies, we have removed their ability to deal critical hits.\nChanged the Nightwave “Episode Status” button to “Nightwave Status” in the Navigation menu.\nThis button appears when players have toggled on to Resource Drones view in their Navigation. \nMade updates to the sounds in the Awakening Quest’s Warframe select screen and cinematics. \n(Hot-dropped on Monday) Re-enabled the ability to decrease your Clan Rank. \nAs explained in the PSA, this temporary measure was taken during Operation: Gargoyle’s Cry to address a bug that prevented Clans from being able to progress in the Operation after decreasing their Rank. Since the Operation concluded on Monday, you can now decrease.\nFixed the map search radius for Necramite Drones not appearing in Netracell missions (including the Whispers in the Walls Quest stage). \nFixed the “kill enemies to lower security level” radius marker in Netracell missions spawning very far from the Security Matrix. \nFixed heat vents in Alchemy missions spawning very far from players. \nFixed Mocking Whispers becoming indefinitely invulnerable after using its Exalted Bladestorm attack and hitting a Revenant player that has Mesmer Skin active. \nFixed being unable to do the quick time event at the end of the Whispers in the Walls Quest if Melee Attack is bound to scrolling the mouse wheel up/down. \nIn order to fix this issue and potential others, you can now tap during these events even if the “Repeated Button Presses” option is set to “Hold” (for both the Keyboard/Mouse and Controller settings). \nFixed Murmur Sarcophages becoming unbreakable after Host Migration. \nFixed Bounty objectives appearing in Netracell missions after starting a Netracell from the Sanctum Anatomica while the Bounty vote is active. \nFixed Clients not hearing the alarm during the “kill enemies to lower security level” stage of the Netracell mission. \nFixed the sound FX for the doors in the Sanctum Anatomica and a vent wall in the Labs being out of sync with their animations. \nTweaked the Vitreum seeking alarm sound FX duration in the Assassination, Effervo mission to match the pulsing VFX. \nImproved the balance between sounds that occur when opening the Netracell. \nFixed certain Vitriol Phials having mesh scaling issues with their puddles. \nFixed the Operator’s head doing a 180 twist while placing an Atropos Prove into a Vitreum in the Assassination, Effervo mission.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed a primary account being automatically selected for you if either of the accounts being linked had been created after the merge cutoff date (November 24 at 2 p.m. ET). \nNow in the case where both accounts were created after the cutoff, you can now choose either as the primary during the linking process. This only applies to first time linking (as has been the case since launch) \nonce the PC account has had other accounts linked in, that PC account is set as the primary. \n(Hot-dropped on Monday) More fixes towards various issues (ex: being unable to equip/unequip Kubrow) occurring when merging accounts that both have Kubrows in various states (incubating, incubated, etc.). To prevent further issues, newly merged accounts automatically put 1 of the 2 Kubrows into Stasis.\nFixed the synergy between Sevagoth’s Reap and Sow abilities (enemies explode when hit by Reap while seeded with Sow) not working for Clients. \nFixed the Dreamer’s Wraith mod only increasing Heavy Attack Critical damage by 20% instead of the intended 32% (at max rank). \nFixed the following issues with Secondary Outburst when used by Clients: \nFixed Clients’ Combo Multipliers not being consumed when switching to Secondary. \nFixed Clients’ Secondary dealing less than the intended damage while Secondary Outburst’s buffs are active. \nFixed an additional +25% (+37% for Tauforged) applying on top of the Violet Archon Shard’s “Gain +25%/+37% Melee Critical Damage. When max Energy is over 500, the damage boost doubles” embed bonus. \nThis bug caused the bonus to exceed well beyond its intended and described values. To break it down, when below 500 Energy the Shard granted +50%/ +74% and when above 500 it granted +75%/+111% (resulted from +25%/+37% applying on top of the intended +50%/+74%). As far as we can tell, this bug has been live since the release of the Violet Archon Shard in the Whispers in the Walls update, so we understand if this fix is disappointing for those who have been using it in this state since then. But in the interest of properly executing the intended bonuses as outlined in the UI, we have restored it to its original design. \nFixed Wukong’s Clone being inactive at the start of the first and second phase of the Archon Hunt fight. \nFixed cases where Exalted Weapons could be unmodded in Duviri.\nExalted Weapons use the Mods in the Config you select for your Warframe in Teshin’s Cave, but in the case where a Config didn’t have Mods equipped onto the Exalted Weapon, there was no fallback system to ensure you didn’t go into Duviri with it unmodded. Now, if a Warframe Mod Config is selected that doesn’t have any Mods equipped for the Exalted Weapon, the game will choose the Exalted Mod Config that uses the most Mod Capacity (as is the case with other equipment in Teshin’s Cave) to prevent players from going into Duviri with a bare bones Exalted Weapon. \nFixed the introductory cinematic in the Heart of Deimos Quest not playing for players on low spec machines, causing them to be unable to progress in the Quest. \nFixed level 6 Terra Sniper Crewmans being able to one-shot Corpus Drones in Fortuna Bounties. \nThey were capable of doing over 1000 damage per shot, so we modified their Snipers while they weren’t looking to be more appropriate for those lower level Bounties. \nFixed the “Auxiliary” tab appearing in the Arsenal even if the Warframe does not have any Auxiliary customizations available. \nFixed bundle items disappearing from the Bundle’s in-game Market page after hitting the “Cancel” button from the “Confirm Purchase” options. \nFixed Nyx’s Chaos Sphere ring VFX appearing as a very thin line. \nFixed the Skaut’s “Kahl Beacon” Air Support missing its name and description in the HUD.\nFixed Daughter and Son using their unranked Entrati Syndicate voice lines at Rank 5.\nFixed a rare issue that could allow a Dojo Room’s construction to be canceled when it had already finished.  \nFixed hitch occurring when selecting a placed Grimoire Altar Decoration while in decorating mode. \n(Missed note from Hotfix 35.0.7) Fixed the Grimoire Altar Decoration missing a panel on the bottom.\n",

  "changes": "Whispers In The Walls: Hotfix 35.0.7:\nChanged the Violet Archon Shard embed bonus affecting Health/Energy pickups to function similarly to the Equilibrium Mod. Now, Health/Energy Orbs can be picked up if one is full, but the other is not to apply the bonus. \nChanged the \"Regenerate Shields when you inflict an enemy with Blast Status\" Topaz Archon Shard embed bonus to no longer apply when Shield Gate is triggered. \nAn unintended degree of invulnerability could be obtained using this effect while continuously triggering Shield Gate, so it was changed to function similarly to Caliban’s Lethal Progeny ability, where the Shield recharge is disabled when Shield Gate is triggered and only resumes when the Shields begin to regenerate themselves. \nChanged the required amount of players needed to start the Effervo boss fight from all squad members to half. This addresses feedback that the boss fight could take a long time to start (and potentially result in Host migrations) if players were off collecting Voca, resources, etc, instead of moving to the boss zone. Players outside of the zone will now be teleported into the arena once activated. \nChanged Pangolin Prime’s Slam attack to match its base version:\nNow applies a forced Slash Status Effect. \nChanged damage type from Impact to Puncture. \nReplaced the “Skip” button in the Circuit reward screen with a “Continue” option if multiple rewards are available. This aims to help prevent players from skipping them all, and instead, will now show the next reward. \nArcanes offerings from Vendors are now displayed as unranked. \nHovering over the Arcane will now display both its unranked and max rank stats. This is to help avoid players thinking they are buying a fully ranked Arcane.\nAdded a Default Mod Config for the Grimoire in Teshin’s Cave options. \nMandonel’s orb will now spin faster during reload for some added flare!\nRemoved mention of Syndicate Sigils in the “Loyalty” Nightwave Act’s tip description, as they are no longer required with the Pledge system to gain Standing.\nImproved spawn rates of The Anatomizer and The Severed Warden enemies in Alchemy Bounties. Particularly to address the issue of being unable to complete the “Kill X Flying Enemies” Bounty Challenge. \nFixed individual Focus School Eidolon Lens Blueprints being rewarded in Rotation C of the Survival, Persto mission instead of the intended Eidolon Lens Blueprint. \nEach individual Lens Blueprint had a drop rate of 10% for each type, so we have adjusted the drop tables to compensate for this change by increasing the drop rate for the Eidolon Lens Blueprint and the Mandonel Barrel and Receiver. More details in the public drop tables. \nFixed cases where Rogue Voidrigs would not spawn/be marked on the map.\nWith this fix, the “Kill 2 Rogue Voidrigs” Bounty Challenge has been re-enabled! It was disabled in Hotfix #2, as the above issue was preventing Bounties from being completed.\nFixed case where Rogue Voidrigs would suddenly teleport to a different location after being spawned by a Rogue Culverin. \nFixed Rogue Culverins’ animations popping while spawning a Rogue Voidrig. \nFixed the map search radius for Necramite Drones not appearing in Netracell missions (including the Whispers in the Walls Quest stage). \nThe fix for this did not make it to the live build as originally thought! Apologies for the confusion \nwe are still investigating. \nFixed reward containers in the Netracells having different Codex entries. \nFixed breaking a Murmur Sarcophages counting as more than one towards the “Find X Murmur Sarcophages” Bounty challenge. \nFixed hitches occurring after hacking a Necramech summon terminal. \nFixed the maximum number of Vitreums that can be activated simultaneously in the Assassination, Effervo mission not scaling based on Squad size. \nFixed damage type icons appearing next to the “Vitreum Seeking” UI in the Assassination, Effervo mission instead of “A, B, C…” to indicate which Vitreum is active and where. \nFixed Murmur Eyes not despawning after its timer has run out in the Assassination, Effervo mission. \nImproved the accuracy of the direction in which broken furniture pieces will fly out when destroyed. We’re collectively keeping the Necramites employed with all this senseless furniture demolition. \nFixed certain character color customizations (if you know you know) not appearing in their transmissions. \nFixed loss of UI functionality in the certain character color customizations screen after saving. \nFixed the Cavia rank up dioramas being obfuscated by Vendor UI if you interacted with them before it appeared. \nFixed opening Operator Equipment in the Sanctum Anatomica in the “Back to the Future” stage of the Whispers in the Walls Quest causing functionality loss. \nFixed minimap waypoint for the Grimoire page not disappearing after collecting it in the “Lost and Found” stage of Whispers in the Walls Quest. Also fixed the Lotus “mission complete” transmission playing on extraction.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed rare instances where selecting an account that has not completed Vor’s Prize as your primary during the merging process would cause progression issues for the merged account.\nFixed rare case where merged PC and Console accounts that were in the same Clan would no longer be a member of it in the merged account.\nIf you have experienced this and would like assistance returning to your Clan, you can submit a ticket to support.warframe.com. \nFixed rare case where TennoGen purchases made via the Steam Workshop would be incorrectly locked to a player’s Console account instead of their PC account (as intended) if the player was logged in on Console at the time of purchase.\nWe are working on a script to correct this for affected players. \nFixed Companion Incubation not progressing after merging two accounts that both had a Companion active.

  "additions": "Added two new Reward Options to the Steel Path Circuit Reward Path: Rivens and Kuva!\nWith Drifter Opportunity Intrinsics at Rank 9, you will be presented with reward options of a Veiled Riven or 20k Kuva in addition to the weekly Incarnon rotation for your Circuit Reward Path!\nJust like the Incarnon Geneses, the order you pick these rewards will determine what Rank you need to complete in the Circuit to earn them.\nAdded VFX when toggling between the Normal and Steel Path modes in the Star Chart screen.\nAdded several new post-Quest voice lines to Saya in Cetus! \nAdded a sound effect to mid-air rolls. Your aerial rolling will be silent no more!\nAdded new Ordis’ lines from the Cephalon Joke-a-Thon Contest winners. \nAdded the Argo & Vel Blueprint to Simaris’ wares for those who own the Drifter variant!\n",
  "changes": "\n\nPlease note that Dagath’s Kaithe shoulder skull is actually an Armor Attachment, titled Dagath Armor, you can equip as desired! We’re aware of an issue that the Dagath Armor unequips itself the first time you enter the Arsenal after purchasing Dagath.

When Shields break, a Satellite is destroyed to double minimum Shield Gate invincibility time.”  \nShield Regeneration Delay Reduction is now capped at 80%. Many Mods have now been updated to offer this benefit, leading to the possibility of stacking Shield Regen to be faster than Shield Gate expiring. Now, players should have easier access to reducing the regeneration time, without risking issues with permanent invulnerability. \nGuardian Break Shield Regeneration delay reduction has been decreased from 90% to 80% at max rank as a result. We have buffed this effect’s duration 8s to 12s at max rank to compensate!\nUpdated the Shield stat on-hover description in the Upgrade Screen to describe Shield break functionality and include Shield Gate duration for your current modded max Shields.  \nIt is NOT intended for Overshields to count for Shield Gate duration. We will be removing this with required Code in our next Cert build.\nVitality: Reduced from +440% to +100% Health\nRedirection: Reduced from +440% to +100% Shield Capacity\nSteel Fiber: Reduced from +110% to +100% Armor\nFlow: Reduced from +150% to +100% Energy Max\nWith this change, Excalibur’s Rank 30 Health stat is 370. With +100% Health from a max Vitality Mod, his resulting Health stat would be 740, which matches what it was originally.\nLavos, Nidus, Nidus Prime, and Kullervo all have buffs to their Armor values as a result of this change.\nEx: Nidus Prime’s Armor stat increased from 910 (previous) to 1,050 (new with this update) with max Steel Fiber Equipped. With all 3 Umbral Warframe Mods equipped, this buff results in a difference of 1198 Armor (previous) to 1470 Armor (new with this update).\nGaruda and Garuda Prime’s received buffs to their Modded Energy pool.\nie. Garuda Prime’s Energy stat has been increased from 800 (previous) to 912 (new with this update) with max Primed Flow equipped.\nTo better contextualize how these numbers have changed, we’ve also prepared a comparison asset using Excalibur:\n\nThese changes in action using Voidrig!\n\nThese changes in action using Odonata!\nAccelerator: Kill 10 Enemies while Sliding (was: 20)\nConservationist: Complete 3 different Perfect Animal Captures in Orb Vallis (was: 6)\nEarth Bounty Hunter: Complete 3 different Bounties in the Plains of Eidolon (was: 5)\nEarth Fisher: Catch 3 Rare Fish in the Plains of Eidolon (was: 6)\nEarth Miner: Mine 3 Rare Gems or Ore in the Plains of Eidolon (was: 6)\nEternal Guardian: Complete 2 Void Armageddon missions (was: 3)\nEverything Old is New Again: Complete 1 Transmutations (was: 3)\nGlider: Kill 15 Enemies while Aim Gliding (was: 20)\nInvader: Complete 6 Invasion missions of any type (was: 9)\nNight and Day: Collect 10 Vome or Fass Residue in the Cambion Drift.

This will allow you to plan your offensive, and find key pick-ups to complete your Stock challenges faster!\nKahl go fast! \nKahl’s max speed and overall walking speed have been increased.\nKahl earn stock! \nAdded Stock Pickups to Break Narmer missions. 8 to 12 Stock Pickups will spawn per mission, offering 2 Stock each. These will appear on your Loot Radar and will respawn if the mission is replayed. Extraction is required to earn the picked-up Stock.\nOgris\nGorvakk (new shotgun found only in Break Narmer missions!)\nIgnis\nTonkor\nGrinlok\nJat Kittag\n*Once Kahl equips the Salvaged Kuva Ayanga in the Junk Run mission, these optional weapons are removed. Once the Tusk Thumper has been defeated, they will respawn. \nAs for Sneaky Sabotage, since this mission has specific weapon restrictions, there are no plans to offer additional weapons to this mission at this time.\n\n\nThis section covers the following topics (in order):\nRemoval of Flawed Mods and MK1 Weapons from Vor’s Prize\nEarly Game Inbox and Junction Adjustments\nUniversal Enemy Radar\nQuest Improvements \nIncluding Waverider, The Glast Gambit, Natah, and Vox Solaris\nAssassination Target Improvements\nCetus Wisp and Necramech Acquisition Changes\nFast Deflection \nnew Max Rank Drain of 7\nRedirection \nnew Max Rank Drain of 12\nEnemy Sense \nnew Max Rank Drain of 7\nContinuity \nnew Max Rank Drain of 7\nVor’s Prize\nAdded new Ordis voice lines when interacting with the Mod Segment during the Quest to set expectations around Modding this early on in the game: “Ordis realizes modding may seem a tad overwhelming, but everything will soon make sense.” \nSaya’s Vigil\nAdded Gara’s Blueprint to this inbox message instead of it being a Quest Completion screen reward!\nFollowing the completion of Saya’s Vigil, we have also written a new inbox from The Business directing players to visit Fortuna.\nKnown Issue: We have identified an issue causing this inbox message to not be delivered with this Update’s launch. We have fixed the issue and it will be coming in an upcoming hotfix.\nOur goal is to better guide newly awakened Tenno through the Star Chart. At the end of Vor’s Prize, they will be directed to Cetus to learn about Codex Scanners and receive their first Warframe Blueprint with a light introduction to Resource and Blueprint acquisition. Then they will be encouraged to follow the Junction path to the next planet.\n \nWe have plans to continue improvements along the Junction path in future updates with the new player experience in mind.\nRemoval of the “Collect 20 Mods” and “Apply 4 mods to a Single Warframe or Weapon” tasks. \nWith the removal of Flawed Mods, the “Apply 4 Mods” challenge may become more difficult. Our goal for Junction tasks is to both teach new Tenno about the game, and guide them where to go next -\nneither of these challenges quite fit that vision. \nNEW TASK: “Complete Quest: Saya’s Vigil”\nSimilar to the Inbox changes, our goal is to direct new players to Cetus early in their journey! It’s an opportunity to meet those the Tenno protect while learning about Codex Scanners and Warframe Blueprints.\nReduced the Rank requirement from 2 to 1 for the “Upgrade any mod through the fusion process” task. Simplified the description as well to better explain how to complete it: \nWas: Use ENDO to upgrade Mods at the MOD STATION in your Orbiter.\nNow: FUSION requires ENDO and CREDITS and is available at the MODS bench in the middle-deck of your Orbiter.\nMercury\nAdded Incubator Power Core to Junction rewards \nHowl of the Kubrow is a Quest unlocked from the Mercury Junction, which requires an Incubator Power Core to complete. The free path to this item was not available until the Mars Junction was completed, which we felt was confusing to many new Tenno eager to hatch their first furry friend.\n\nWe’ve reduced the number of challenges per page from 5 to 3, resulting in a whopping reduction of overall Quest requirements from 25 to 15 challenges!\nWith fewer challenges overall, we’ve reworked the remaining challenges with the focus of making them simpler and easier to complete while still showcasing the breadth of gameplay available on your K-Drive!\nAdded the Quest Challenges to the pause menu while it is active to increase visibility and reduce the inconvenience of reopening the comic every time you need to check your progress. Hovering over a challenge will also provide you with a “how-to” description, offering more details on how to complete the listed objective!\nAdded Quest icon to the prompting text lines when interacting with Boon in Fortuna, to help players identify which dialogue prompt to click to proceed with the Quest stages. \nThe Yareli Comic is now accessible in the Vent Kids’ Clubhouse in Fortuna while the Waverider Quest is active. Instead of having to return to your Orbiter to check challenge progress, players have an additional option of visiting Boon and reading the comic there!\nAdded a “Skip All” button to the Yareli Comic Pages for players who want to skip past the narration and read the pages themselves.\nHere's a look at what the Waverider Quest Challenges are now: \nPAGE 1:\nCopter x 5\nComplete a K-Drive Race\nKill 5 enemies with a Secondary Weapon while riding a K-Drive\nPAGE 2\nNose Planker or Tail Planker x 5\nObtain 5 seconds of air-time on a K-Drive\nGet 5 Headshot Kills with a Secondary Weapon while riding a K-Drive\nPAGE 3:\nKeep a K-Drive trick chain alive for 10 seconds\nFrontside Rollout x 5\nBackside Rollout x 5\nPAGE 4:\nPAGE 5:\nKill 5 enemies while mid-air/during a trick chain\nCollect a total of 10,000 race points\nEarn 500 points in a K-Drive trick chain\nReduced enemy level from 6-8 to 5, matching subsequent missions in this Quest.\nIncreased Drone Health and Shields from 3k to 8k, respectively.\nReduced the number of required kills from 30 to 20.\nMISSION 2:\nReduced enemy level from 6-8 to 5, matching subsequent missions in this Quest.\nMISSION 3:\nIncreased Excavator shields from 500 to 3k to match Health values.\nMISSION 5:\nReduced enemy starting level to 7 from 9.\nIncreased Coolant Tower Health and Shields from 3k to 10k, respectively.\nReduced the length of each Index round from 3 to 2 minutes. Since you have to play multiple Index rounds per mission, we felt it dragged on too long.\nIncreased the Victory Margin from 10 to 20. While Nef may be balking at your success, we understand that the original margin was a pain point for many players, and we hope this improves that!\nReduced the MR requirement from 3 to 2, meaning Oculysts will now spawn in Uranus missions once you are MR 2!\nUpdated the Uranus Junction challenge description to better indicate how to start this Quest. \n“Unlock this Quest via a special event in Grineer missions on Uranus. These events only trigger if you are Mastery Rank 2 or above.” \nReduced the number of Defense waves from 10 to 5 in the “Seal the Tomb” mission.\nThe Archwing: Reduced Odonata build time from 10 minutes to 1 minute.\nThe Limbo Theorem:  Reduced Limbo Blueprint craft times from 12 hours to 1 minute. We are also reducing the number of Proof fragments required for the Theorem Blueprints from 3 to 1. \nSaya’s Vigil: Removed the MR 1 requirement to access Saya’s Vigil as part of our other early game journey changes. \nRising Tide: Reduced the Railjack Cephalon Blueprint build time from 10 mins to 1 min.\nApostasy Prologue: Added “how to unlock” hint text in Codex to guide players to complete the Chains of Harrow Quest and install the Personal Quarters Segment.\nReduced round timer from 120 to 90 seconds. \nReduced required number of Hacked Ambulas\nFrom 4 to 3 for single player squads\nFrom 5 to 4 for two player squads\nFrom 6 to 4 for three and four player squads. \nFor experienced squads, taking down the Ambulas could lead to long periods of waiting. With these changes, we hope to reduce the amount of overall downtime in this fight, while not making it too difficult for those who have yet to master it.\nVay Hek:\nReduced Invulnerability period from 10 to 6 seconds. \nIncreased maximum damage received before becoming invulnerable from 25% to 35%. \nThese changes should increase the frequency at which Vay Hek becomes vulnerable to damage, therefore speeding up the fight!\nTyl Regor:\nWaypoint on Tyl Regor now disappears when he is hiding.\nPreviously it would direct players to a locked door, possibly leading to confusion.\nAdded Waypoint Markers to Manics while they are active.\n\n\nCharacter Highlighting System\nConservation Accessibility and QOL Improvements\nAuto Melee \nBuffs and Debuffs in Pause Menu\nNew Update History Screen\nOther UI / HUD Additions and Changes\n\nIn the screenshot above, you can see the full array of settings available to you in our Accessibility Settings Screen:\nEnemy Highlights Toggle \nToggling this on applies the Highlight Aura to all enemies.\nEnemy Highlight Color \nSelect the color of choice using the Accessibility Color Palette or any other owned Color palette.\nEnemy Highlight Intensity \nChoose how bright you’d like the Highlight to be using this sliding scale. \nAlly Highlights \nToggling this on applies the Highlight Aura to all allies, including but not limited to: Squad Members, Companions / Sentinels, and Specters.\nSelf Highlight \nApply the Ally Highlight settings to your player avatar.\nThis will persist anywhere you take your Warframe or Tenno, such as your Orbiter, Quests, etc!\nAlly Highlight Color \nSelect the color of choice using the Accessibility Color Palette or any other owned Color palette.\nAlly Highlight Intensity \nChoose how bright you’d like the Highlight to be using this sliding scale.\nInteracting with the Color and Intensity options will preview the effect on your Warframe in the menu screen, giving you an idea of what it’ll look like in-mission! Here is a preview of gameplay with this system in action:\nU35_Character Highlighting In Action_Option B.mp4Unavailable\nA few key characteristics of note for this system:\n“Friendly” enemy units such as those seen in Invasion missions or those affected by Revenant’s Thralls / Nyx’s Mind Control units / etc. will use the Ally Highlight settings to differentiate them from your true foes.\nCharacter Highlight Settings are accessible in-mission should you need to make any tweaks on the fly!\nOur intentions are for the majority of Quest cutscenes you will not see Character Highlights in action, except if Self Highlights are applied. Currently this is not the case and all allies and enemies are highlighted. We have a code fix that will come with our next Cert build.\nU34_Trail Start GIF.mp4Unavailable\nTrail Start Points will now be highlighted with a diamond marker with the Tranq Rifle equipped. Simply holding the Tranq Rifle will show these markers at 20m away, while aiming down the scope will reveal them from up to 50m away.\nThis diamond marker functionality already existed with Echo-Lures, but we are extending it to Tranq Rifles as well. \nTrail Start Points will now glow similar to footprints when viewed through the Tranq Rifle scope.\nUpdated our footprint shader to improve animal footprint visibility and address issues of them disappearing below rocky terrain.\nOnce interacting with a Trail Start Point, a yellow area highlight will appear in your minimap over the last section of the tracks you found. Additionally, we have added diamond markers at key checkpoints in the footprint path that appear when looking down the Tranq Rifle scope.\nIf you happen to lose the trail or get turned around, these two mechanics should help you!\nAdjusted the audio and visual cues from the Tranq Rifle to play more or less frequently depending on how far away the animal is.\nThe more often they appear, the closer you are! \nAlly Character Highlights will apply to Conservation targets as an extra way to distinguish them from the landscape, should you wish to use that system!\nAdded a flashing paw icon that points you in the direction of the animal when looking down the Tranquilizer scope.\nWith the successful use of the Echo-Lure, the replying animal call already comes from the direction that they spawn in. We’re adding this new visual clue for Conservationists in addition to the existing audio cue! \nNote: This functionality also applies to free-roaming wildlife you find on the Landscape, no Echo-Lure required!\nU34_Tranq Rifle Indicator GIF.mp4Unavailable\nAll Glaive Weapon Types     \nWolf Sledge\nAs you can see in the screenshot above, hovering over the icon will show you the effect’s name and possibly the description. We've done our best to add descriptions for Arcanes, Mods, Decrees, Focus Abilities, and Weapon Abilities in time for this update. As the majority of descriptions are still being added, we ask that any bug reporting is done on incorrect or incomplete descriptions instead of missing ones!\nIn the screenshot above, you’ll see various sections designed to contextualize and highlight released in the specific update, including:\nIn the pause menu above the Nightwave button.\nVia the new banner over the News console in your Orbiter!\nAdded a Weapon Trait Display in the Arsenal! \nWeapons with specific traits or passives now display this information in the Upgrade Arsenal screen of the respective weapon. These traits were often hidden in weapon descriptions or otherwise required players to learn about them via outside sources \nnow you can directly see any special traits a weapon has and incorporate that knowledge into your builds. \nEach and every single trait was written for this update, which means some may have slipped by! Please let us know if there are weapons missing their own trait description. Thank you!\nThis new Trait display is placed where the previous “Rank Bonuses” information lived. We have moved the “Rank Bonuses” section of the Upgrade Screen just above the Ability Icons, where players can still access that information on-hover. \nAdded a preview feature when adjusting the Visual Effects Intensity slider.\nYou can now swap Incarnon Evolutions in the Arsenal! \nNote: You will still need to visit Cavalero to unlock each Evolution, but once that’s done, you can swap to your heart’s delight from the comfort of your Orbiter. \nU34_Incarnon Arsenal Evolution Swap_V2.mp4\n \nUpdated the reticle’s reaction when hitting headshots and weak points to a much more visible and red indicator. \nAdded a new \"Damage Number\" color slot for non-critical damage. Default is white but can be customized in the “Customize HUD Colors” settings.\nPlayers can now see how many open Slots they own when hovering over an item that requires Slots in the Foundry! The number and slot type will appear at the bottom of the Foundry screen when hovering over an applicable Blueprint.\nKnowing how many open Slots you have is an important part of expanding your Arsenal, but this information can be hard to find if you don’t know where to look! This change allows players to get that information much more quickly, and offers more transparency on how the Slot mechanic works for those unfamiliar with it!\nRailjack Crew members can now be customized by hovering over their character models. Doing so will display all of the options in a single menu, a much more convenient way to personalize your team! \nAdded a new pop-up when picking up Convergence Orbs to explain Convergence functionality. \nThe message “Eliminate enemies to earn bonus Focus for the next 45s” will now appear briefly below the bonus Focus pop-up. For more information on the bonus Focus pop-up, read on to the Focus Lens Conversion Buff section. A follow-up message will now also appear once you have reached the daily cap. \nAdded a “Claim Rewards” indicator on the Nightwave Button accessed via the pause menu when you have a Nightwave reward pending. \nRemoved the ability to see how many Trades Remaining the other player has in the Trading Interface. \nThis change was the result of fixing a bug where the Trade Remaining number was not accurate. Ultimately it was decided that this information is not really relevant for other players to know, so it was removed.\nAdded drop shadow to Buff Icons in the HUD to improve their visibility, especially when in light colored environments. \nAdded new VFX feedback when Health and Shields are restored. The HUD color (default gray) is also customizable with the new “Restored Shields and Health” option in the Customize HUD Colors Accessibility settings.\n\nCompanion Immortality \nCompanion Stat Changes\nCompanion Healing \nCompanion Mod Changes & Additions\nAnd more!\nYour furry, robotic, fleshy, and everything in between pals have received a rework! Read on to learn how the way you use, Mod, and interact with your Companions has changed in this first phase of the Companion system overhaul.\nKavats, Kubrows, MOAs, and Predasites will now collapse on the ground and can be, optionally, manually revived to get them back into action quicker.\nSentinels cannot be manually revived, but they will fly along with you in a damaged state while performing their automatic self-revive.\nVulpaphylas still have their usual tricks instead, where they morph into a Sentinel-like state for a short period and then recover.\nKhora's Venari still uses its usual behavior of temporarily disappearing if defeated, but you can override its time-out by spending Energy to cast her Venari Ability.\nWorth noting that Vacuum and Animal Instinct work while the Companion is Incapacitated.\nWith Incapacitation, Companions can now recover from being downed in Arbitration missions, instead of staying dead for the duration of the mission.\nSeveral Mods have been modified or introduced that also change when or how your Companion deals with Incapacitation \nsee the “Companion Mod Changes & Additions” section below for specifics.\nIncluding both the removal of Companion Rank bonuses, and the base increase to stats, the following lists the stat changes for all Companions at Rank 0:\nNezha’s Warding Halo\nTrinity’s Blessing\nEmber’s Immolation\nGaruda’s Blood Altar\nGara’s Splinter Storm\nStyanax’ Intrepid Stand\nMirage’s Eclipse\nVolt’s Discharge\nBaruuk’s Desolate Hands\nHarrow’s Penance\nHarrow’s Thurible\nEquinox’ Mend & Maim\nSancti Magistar’s Heavy Attack Heal\nVazarin’s Protective Sling\nStats below are shown at Max Rank.\nThese Mods are available to acquire at the Conservation vendors in Cetus (Master Teasonai), Fortuna (The Business), and the Necralisk (Son).\n*Stats below are shown at Max Rank.\nAvailable In Master Teasonai’s Offerings (Cetus):\nAvailable In The Business’ Offerings (Fortuna):\nAvailable In Son’s Offerings (Necralisk):\n*Work is still ongoing for this mod, we are aware of some Robotic Companion Precepts which do not trigger the bonus Status Effects.\nSentinels now avoid damage from Arson Eximus explosions if you also avoid damage with a successful dodge.\nThe improvement to Shield Gating where it now scales with maximum Shield strength and fully resets as long as you have any Shield charge at all, also applies to Companions.\nCompanions can now gain Overguard (behaves the same as player Overguard) and Overshield. \nHealth and Energy conversion will now enable picking up Orbs at max capacity. This applies to the Equilibrium Mod as well. \nAdded map icons for each Companion type to help identify their location. \nReduced the amount of Alloy Plates required to craft the Kavat Incubator Upgrade Segment from 120,000 to 60,000. \nImproved Companion HUD information: \nRemoved notifications for when other players’ Companions are downed (Incapacitated) to reduce HUD noise. You will now only get notified for your own Companion. \nYour Companion now has its very own icon in the HUD. \nUpdated the Imprints error message to be more accurate: \nWas: \"Cannot make imprints of pets when they have not yet matured. Wait for active pet to become an adult before creating imprint.\"\nNow: \"Cannot make imprints of pets when they have not yet matured. Mature to an adult before creating imprint.\"\nOberon's Passive now applies to all Companion Types.\nPreviously only Kavats, Kubrows, Predasites, and Vulpaphylas would receive +25% Health, Armor, and Shield links, plus the 1 instant revive per mission.\nCompanions are no longer able to be staggered! \nBecause staggering would often stop your pets in-place, it opened them up to being re-staggered, which then often led to their swift demise. This should fix that issue, and allow your furry and not-so-furry friends to have more impact in-mission.\n\nThe goal of the Hydroid rework was to keep his unique style while making him both easier to use and bringing his power more in line with other Warframes. This means changing how his abilities work through changes to their damage types, removing charging mechanics, and making enemies easier to hit while they are wrapped up in his abilities. Additionally, it meant reworking his passive and removing the Undertow ability, replacing it with the new Plunder ability.\nFor a closer look at our deadly marauder of the deep, let's dive right in!\n\nPreviously, Tempest Barrage and Tidal Surge both dealt Impact damage, while Tentacle Swarm dealt Magnetic Damage. These have been changed to Corrosive Damage, which can apply Corrosive Status. Corroding Barrage has been a widely used Augment Mod by Hydroid players, which caused Corrosive Status for Tempest Barrage, and due to its popularity, we looked to incorporate its effect into Hydroid at a base level.\nWe felt changing Damage to Corrosive Damage in Hydroid’s abilities makes them more thematic to the sea while also incorporating Corroding Barrage’s current effect in a meaningful way. With this change in mind, Corroding Barrage will now apply Viral Status instead of Corrosive \nmore details on that below.\nThe nature of Hydroid’s previous Passive pushed players to a very specific playstyle (regular usage of melee slam attacks), while not guaranteeing anything useful from each individual slam. We wanted to make the passive feel more reliable and impactful.\nNew Passive: Enemies damaged by Hydroid are more vulnerable to Corrosion Status, with initial status reducing armor by 50%.\nHydroid’s new Passive affects an enemy once Hydroid damages them, lasting until their death. It makes the first instance of Corrosive Status on an enemy remove 50% of their Armor rather than 26%. Not only does this make the first Corrosive Status stronger, but it also means Corrosion Status can reach 100% Armor Reduction with full stacks!\nTo clarify, this means Hydroid does not need to apply all, or even any, of the Corrosive Status Effects on an enemy. As long as Hydroid has damaged the enemy, the Corrosive Status Effects can be applied from any source and will receive the benefit.\nFor example, previously, an uncharged Tentacle Swarm would have 40% of the tentacles and 33% of the radius compared to a fully charged cast. With this change, both tentacle count and radius will always be the maximum, what a fully charged cast was previously.\nThis change makes Hydroid’s play more fluid, with more time spent attacking rather than charging abilities for their maximum effect.\n\nTempest Barrage staggers enemies instead of ragdoll, making them easier to target.\n\nThis ability has been removed and replaced with Plunder.\nUndertow was an ability which we feel made Hydroid a bit less fun to play as, or play with. There are two main reasons we decided to replace this ability:\nIt forced the player to remain stationary, while many objectives rely on regular movement.\nIt absorbed enemies without instantly killing them, which could lead to instances of hiding enemies that a teammate was trying to kill.\n\nNow holds enemies in a steadier position, making it easier to eliminate enemies locked down by Tentacles.\nIf a tentacle’s held enemy dies, it will move to grab a new enemy in the Tentacle Swarm’s area of effect.\nUpdated Tentacle sound and visual effects.\n\n\n\n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to convert Operator Skins for Drifter use, the Operator Zauba and Commodore Prime Suits can now be equipped onto your Drifter!\n\n*Raven Drifter is seen in the above image.\nFuture purchases of these customizations will now include the matching Drifter variants. For those of you that already own these collections, the Drifter versions will be added to your inventory upon log-in.\nDualShock 4 and DualSense controllers are now officially supported in Warframe on PC (for Windows 8 and up users)!\nSteam-Input users:\nSteam config for DualShock controllers has been vastly simplified and will now automatically work with Warframe using the Default Controller Settings in Steam. Simply click the cog on the top right, then “Properties”, then “Controller” and change the “Override for Warframe” option to “Use default settings” from the dropdown list.\n\n\nDS4Win users:\nWe recommend stopping DS4Win when playing Warframe now that native support for the DualShock 4 and DualSense controllers has been added.\nWith Warframe’s built-in support enabled, changes made to Warframe’s Steam Input (e.g. with Steam Deck) In-Game Action Files (input configuration, etc.) will no longer cause disruptions to DualShock use as they once did. Steam Input’s binding model had certain limitations due to there being no official support in Warframe, but that is now an issue of the past!\nAdded an “Auto” option to the Upscaling Quality video settings. This option determines the correct upscaling quality based on the output resolution. \nReplaced the Nvidia Image Scaler when using DLSS with AMD’s RCAS. This gives more consistent results and means all upscalers now use the same sharpening. \nAdded XeSS support for DX12 and AMD’s RCAS sharpening.\nFixed graphical issues with the minimap and several on-hover popups (Mission Node in Navigation, Market descriptions, etc.) while Upscaling options are enabled.\nExplosive Barrels on paper may seem like a blast, but their impact in-mission is not quite up to snuff. In this update, we’ve brought these environmental hazards back with a bang with the following changes:\nExplosive Barrels now deal a % of an enemy’s Health to help them scale with higher level content. Players will receive a reduced amount of damage from Barrels to prevent deadly accidents -\non par with the amount of damage they would have received before this change.\nPreviously, these barrels dealt a flat damage value which had little impact on high-level foes. \nLN2 Barrels (Cold) and Spent Radium Barrels (Radiation) will now deal full stacks of Cold and Radiation Status Effects respectively for enemies standing within the shockwave.\nRemoved the 0.35s delay before explosion upon Barrel destruction. \nReduced the range of explosion from 15m to 10m and added scaling damage values based on how close the enemy is to the Barrel.\nImproved overall VFX of the Barrel explosion to showcase the blast radius, and make the kills feel punchier. \nFixed explosion line of sight checks being blocked by other enemies. Explosions will still respect environmental obstacles (walls, etc.), but now enemies within the blast radius will not survive simply because they were standing behind someone else!\nGround Finishers now ignore the Armor value of enemies as other types of Finishers do. This affects the following: \nHunter’s Bonesaw now grants 120% Finisher Damage instead of Status Chance since Ground Finishers now deal Finisher Damage which does not proc Status.  \nFixed several cases where the game was not recognizing a Ground Finisher for the activation of Mods and Arcanes. The intent is that Ground Finishers, Stealth Finishers and Parazon Finishers should be equivalent unless explicitly stated otherwise:\nDuviri Decrees will now accept Ground Finishers (Tamm's Fortune, Brimon's Nerve, Molten Mettle)\nInaros' Desiccation Curse augment will now create sand minions on Ground Finishers\nArcane Trickery will now activate from Ground Finishers\nArcane Ultimatum will now activate from Ground Finishers\nExodia Might will now activate from Ground Finishers\nImproved the accuracy of water ripples when running through a body of water.\nVoruna’s Ulfrun's Descent kills will now count as Melee for synergy with Lycath's Hunt Health orb drops. \nWe’ve revamped how the game audio mix is handled when casting Warframe abilities and firing weapons to improve spatial sound awareness. Now, you’ll be able to hear the environment and gameplay sounds much more clearly in certain scenarios. We also fixed some issues with certain abilities and weapons causing gameplay sounds to playback too quietly. \nGaining Health, Shields, and Overguard now provide more gradual feedback in the health bar instead of instantly changing.\nImproved the Decree rerolling randomization to prevent the same Decrees from appearing again after rerolls. \nImproved the Incarnon UI VFX to better indicate when charges have been depleted. \nIn preparation for the introduction of Cross Platform Play Clans, the way resources are refunded from canceling Dojo Rooms and Decorations has been changed to ensure parity between Cross Platform and non-Cross Platform Play Clans. Instead of the resources returning to the contributing players’ inventories, it will now be refunded to the Clan Vault. \nBuffs or mechanics that are triggered upon Health or Energy Orb pickup can now be triggered if your Health or Energy pools are at max. This includes Mods like Equilibrium!\nIf your buffs are fully stacked, you will no longer pick up these Orbs at max Health/Energy. \nOrokin Vaults on Deimos can now be highlighted by the Orokin Eye Air Support ability.\nAdjusted Auto-Install prioritization based on new Warframe Health and Shield values, as well as checking for Shield Recharge Delay. \nOperator Amps can now interrupt Dax abilities in the Undercroft similar to how weapon fire can. \nAsh and Stalker (playable) can now cast Teleport on Defense objectives. \nThis was previously fixed in Hotfix 33.0.7 due to the issues and inconsistencies with the landing spot (getting stuck in objective upon landing). We have now improved the targeting to prevent that and have re-enabled it! \nUpdated the Imprints error message to be more accurate: \nWas: \"Cannot make imprints of pets when they have not yet matured. Wait for active pet to become an adult before creating imprint.\"\nNow: \"Cannot make imprints of pets when they have not yet matured. Mature to an adult before creating imprint.\"\nGrand Master Founder aliases are now highlighted in the Relays’ Honored Grand Masters panels. \nUpdated Entropy Burst and Napalm Grenade’s descriptions to clarify that it applies after Mods like Rifle Aptitude by changing “Base Status Chance” to “Final Status Chance”. \nWas: +20 Base Status Chance, +1 ‘Entropy’\nNow: +20 Final Status Chance, +1 ‘Entropy’ \nUpdated some Archwing HUD assets with higher resolution ones. \nThe Secondary Outburst Arcane has received some overall buffs! Additionally, we’ve fixed it not functioning properly and its description being inaccurate. The new description is as follows:\nOn swapping to Secondary Weapon, consume all Combo Multipliers to increase Secondary Weapon Critical Chance and Critical Damage by 5/7/9/12/16/20% per Combo consumed for 30s.\nChanged the Thermal Sunder Helminth ability to have an altered attribute of “Scaling from Heat Status on enemies capped to 10x ability damage.” \nA deeper dive into its Subsumed version on other Warframes showed us there was a Damage Over Time issue where Heat procs were scaling with unlimited exponential damage, therefore, we have implemented the cap. \nChanged the Faction Damage Mod (includes Bane, Cleanse, Expel, Smite, Railjack, and Riven Faction Stats) descriptions to use multiplier instead of percentage based stat formatting. Damage values have not changed! Just the way they are communicated. \nFor example: Smite Corpus (at max rank) \nWas: “+30% Damage to Corpus.” \nNow: “x1.3 Damage to Corpus.” \nThis change better communicates how Faction Damage is calculated, since calculation occurs when you hit the enemy, as opposed to when you shoot like other damage sources (since it needs to know what Faction is being hit). For that reason, multipliers apply to final damage as a whole and not just part of the formula! \nUpdated Zariman Extraction button in the Elevator to start a 60 second Extraction timer for Hosts in endless missions. \nClients will still be automatically extracted from the mission when using this button. We have added this special functionality for Hosts to allow Clients the option to extract as well, should they wish to avoid a Host Migration. \nReduced Shields on Corpus Allies in the “Prison Break” Break Narmer mission to be more in line with Grineer Brothers total health values. \nYou can now use TAB to switch between the “Name” and “Message” text fields in the “Add Friend” window.  \nNon-Critical Little Duck transmissions in Disruption missions can now be turned on or off with the \"Enable Hint Transmissions\" toggle in the Audio Options.\nRemoved the \"Y\" keyboard binding to cancel a mission vote. \nThe binding was rather counterintuitive (\"Y\" for NO vote) and not entirely intended (as was apparent with the lack of button callout in the UI). Additionally, we want to prevent it negatively affecting how controllers are able to interact with the voting bindings.\nOptimized trail particles count on the Latron Incarnon Genesis’ projectile.  \nMade micro-optimizations to DirectX 12 shader prefetching.\nMade systemic micro-optimizations to DirectX drivers. \nMade systemic micro-optimizations to memory footprint for all platforms.\nOptimized screenshot capturing to reduce the hitch time. \nFixed a hitch in performance when opening the Railjack Tactical Menu. \nFixed a rare crash that could occur when using DirectX 12 after upgrading drivers. \nFixed a rare issue where Clients could experience long hitches in Archwing Rush missions if remaining players stayed at spawn.\nMade micro-optimization to DirectX 12 rendering.\nMade micro-optimizations to DirectX 12 prefetching.\nMade systemic micro-optimizations to memory on all platforms.\n",
  "fixes": "\nMeaning that everything the team has been working on since the launch of Echoes of Duviri is in this update (with the obvious exception of content that is not ready to be released). It is very likely, as it is with all Mainline updates, that things slip through the cracks so we will be watching for bug reports and feedback in the Dedicated Abyss of Dagath Subforums to address in follow-up Hotfixes.\nIf any of the terms above are new to you, visit “The Warframe Lexicon for Updates” to learn more about Warframe’s development cycle.\n\nIn this mission you have two objectives:\n1. Exterminate the required amount of enemies\n2.

Similar to Datamasses, players carrying a Defixio will still be able to use their Secondary and Melee weapons, and can pick up or drop their payload at will.\n\nAdditionally, nearing the required amount of slain enemies will trigger a call for reinforcements, turning your mission into an Eximus Stronghold until you successfully extract.\n\n\nWyrd Scythes is Dagath’s Helminth ability (Altered: Diminished Slow) and Railjack ability.\nHow To Acquire Dagath: \nDagath can be purchased for instant access in the in-game Market for Platinum or her Blueprints can be collected from the new “Dagath’s Hollow” Dojo Room (read below to learn more) and crafted using Vainthorn earned from the new Abyssal Zone Exterminate Node.\nWith the release of Dagath, the number of purchasable loadout slots has been increased from 21 to 22.\n\nHow To Acquire Dagath’s Ganceann Helmet: \nThe Helmet can be purchased from the in-game Market. Its Blueprint will be added to the next Nora's Mix Series store  \nwe will update you in the near future on when to expect it.\nHow To Acquire Dorrclave: \nAcquire Dorrclave’s Blueprints from the new Dagath’s Hollow Dojo Room (read below to learn more) and earn Vainthorn from the new Abyssal Zone Exterminate Node to craft its components.\n\nThe spirit of Dagath’s Kaithe Rakhali is strong here \nallowing you access to your Kaithe and all of its customization options.\n\n\nNow that Grendel Prime Access is available, the following items have been added to the Prime Vault for a future Prime Resurgence rotation. If you have Relics that contain these items they will remain in your Inventory.\nHarrow Prime\nScourge Prime\nKnell Prime\nWith this Vaulting comes the shift of the following Syndicate Sacrifices:\nReplaced Rank 5 Cephalon Suda sacrifice of Harrow Prime Neuroptics to Khora Prime Chassis\nReplaced Rank 4 The Perrin Sequence sacrifice of Knell Prime Barrel to Hystrix Prime Receiver\nReplaced Rank 5 Red Veil sacrifice of Harrow Prime Systems to Garuda Prime Systems\n\nFixed Hema’s magazine size shrinking when it's used with Equinox equipped with the Duality Augment Mod. \nFixed Mirage’s Eclipse not providing the Damage Reduction buff when positioned in the shadowed areas of Duviri and the Undercroft. \nFixed Undercroft Jackal being overly affected by Cold Status Effects which would drastically slow down the fight. \nFixed Gorgon Incarnon challenge for Evolution IV not resetting when reloading if you’re the Client.\nFixed Nova’s Antimatter Drop damage being inconsistent between Host and Client. \nWith the same Mod loadout, Clients were doing significantly less damage than the Host (who had the intended damage output). \nFixed Decrees going missing after reconnecting to an active Duviri or Circuit session. \nFixed Host migration causing Clients in the Circuit to not receive their Decree from collecting all the Decree Fragments and completing the stage.\nFixed Orowyrm becoming immortal after destroying all its rings, causing a halt in progress. \nFixed an issue where shooting enemies in Zephyr's Tornadoes would not register critical hits (notably with the Stahlta). \nFixed weapons with Incarnon Genesis not being offered as options in Teshin's Cave. \nFixed older accounts seeing incorrect on-screen controller callouts  for the “Chord” binding in the Shawzin Duviri side-objective. \nFixed Styanax’s Intrepid Stand Augment Mod unintentionally granting mind control immunity to Nyx’s mind-controlled enemies and Revenant’s Thralls.\nFixed a bug where Atlas's Tectonics wall wouldn't respawn or roll when destroyed by enemies as a Client.\nFixed changing graphics quality presets not immediately update all settings.\nFixed Chroma’s elemental damage defaulting to Heat in the Undercroft regardless of the selected emissive colors.\nFixed an issue in The Duviri Experience where players would lose their Decrees after Host migration.\nFixed a loss of function after opening the Decree menu while being staggered in The Duviri Experience. \nFixed the Data Mass in The Greenway Zariman Mobile Defense mission disappearing  when attempting to pick up a Zarium Accolade.\nFixed freezing in place while attempting to pick up items.\nFixed Orokin Vaults not giving players an “Unidentified Reward” pop-up and reward in their Mission Progress Screen once players interact with the corrupted artifact. \nWhile players earned a random Corrupted Mod and Orokin Cipher through unlocking these vaults, these rewards were never used the “Unidentified Reward” pop-up that was introduced later in Warframe’s development. We’re adding it now to reduce any player confusion!\nFixed an issue that allowed multiple Thumper weak points to be destroyed at the same time, resulting in it becoming invulnerable. \nFixed triggering Galvanized Aptitude on the Telos Boltor Incarnon granting it far more direct hit damage (at times tenfold) than intended. \nFixed being able to gain Affinity from Ember's Inferno when no enemies are within range. Affinity on Ability cast is tied to Energy cost, and since Inferno has a free-cast trait this slipped by!\nFixes towards the Dex Drifter/Operator Suit not taking on black and dark saturated colors very well. \nPure black ended up to be more of a shiny medium silver, and saturated colores ended up with a lot of white mixed in. Only very pale colors accurately reflected player color choices prior to this fix. \nFixed the Codex being accessible during The New War Quest after restarting the game. \nFixed the controller button callout missing in the HUD tip to use Transference on Umbra in The Sacrifice Quest. \nFixed Kullervo being unable to move as well as getting permanently stuck in walls after using Wrathful Advance’s teleport mode (hold cast). \nFixed Decrees from previous session being active in a new session after aborting from Duviri.

Resets on missed shot)  resetting if ANY arrow in a volley is missed. This has been changed to be much more forgiving, and will now reset if ALL arrows miss. Each projectile still contributes to the stacks. \nFixed Specters ignoring ammo drops from Protea’s Dispensary. \nFixed camera snapping 180 degrees upon triggering Last Grasp and Transference. \nFixed Steel Path difficulty modifiers not applying to Void Angels. \nFixed Ash’s Shruikens pathing being widely inconsistent when pressed up against objects (walls, etc.) when cast, causing them to not fly directly towards enemies. \nFixed the Evolution IV challenge (Kill 40 enemies while airborne) for the Gammacor Incarnon (base and Synoid) tracking kills while not in the air as required. \nFixed Overguard disappearing from the UI while riding K-Drive/Merulina. \nFixed Excalibur Umbra sometimes ceasing to function after getting impaled by Void Angels. \nFixed enemies remaining disarmed permanently from a disarming ability (e.g. Baruuk’s Desolate Hands) after Host migration. \nFixed getting hit by Jackal's gridwall attack even while taking cover in a spot below it and made other general improvements to lasers vs. obstacle interactions.  \nFixed Ropalolyst becoming immune after Host migration during the final stage. \nFixed the Navigation and other fast travel options disappearing from the pause menu upon aborting from a Railjack mission and returning to a Featured Dojo.\nFixed Orowyrm having Shields unintentionally which made it impossible to defeat, even after destroying its rings. \nFixed FOV settings getting reset to default upon restarting the game. \nFixed Archon Nira getting downed and stuck in walls during her grapple ability. A small invulnerability phase has been added when she performs this ability to prevent this issue from occurring. \nFixed enemy armor indicators not working properly with Steel Path modifiers. \nMaximum armor is now determined as the highest amount of modified armor the damage controller has had, rather than limited to explicit changes to the base armor rating since Steel Path doesn't change the base armor.\nFixed a Host Migration issue for the Ropalolyst fight that allowed players to see a charged pillar which in reality was not charged at all!\nFixed a Host Migration issue for the Ropalolyst fight that could leave Clients locked in the arena after the fight. \nFixed a Host Migration issue that caused a Client to lose functionality when entering The Lone Story Undercroft. \nFixed a Host Migration issue where not enough enemies would spawn during a Duviri Undercroft Defense.\nFixed Pathocyst’s heavy charged projectile dealing the same damage as quick attack.\nFixed Rauta's passive not adding Combo Counter to Melee weapons if the Melee has not already accumulated 1x Combo Counter through use.\nFixed being able to apply crowd control effects to the Jackal on Venus, preventing unintended behavior.\nFixed Braton Incarnon’s Prelude of Might perk always applying instead of on its intended trigger condition (with Critical Chance Below 50%). \nFixed issues with certain Video settings not updating to the correct option when changing the Quality Presets. Here are the intended presets for the settings that were incorrect: \nLow Preset: \nGPU Particle Quality: Low\nDistortions: Disabled\nFilm Grain: Disabled \nMedium Preset: \nGPU Particle Quality: Medium \nAnti-Aliasing: SMAA (Medium) \nHigh Preset: \nAnti-Aliasing: TAA 8X (High) \nContact Shadows: Enabled\nFixed Hildryn missing controller rumbles for all of her abilities.\nFixed becoming permanently stuck in Operator mode if a squadmate migrates while you are on a K-Drive or Merulina.\nFixed using Transference after reviving with Last Gasp would cause strange camera snapping.\nFixed Limbo being able to Banish Open Zone Excavators, which is inconsistent to other mission Excavators.\nFixed certain causes of getting punted back to the Undercroft waiting area if you died in the Undercroft having not moved.\nFixed Enabling HDR and Upscaling being an overly convoluted process to complete due to erroneous fields being grayed out. \nFixed the Captura Slow Motion setting applying to the pause menu UI motion and Arsenal UI motion.\nFixed the skybox in both the Courtier’s Bliss and Harbinger's Pass Dojo Rooms turning default when another player is adding or destroying a Dojo Room.\nFixed magazine remaining in the Warframe's left hand if the reload for the Tenet Flux Rifle is interrupted. \nFixed being unable to enter the portals in Duviri (Teshin’s Cave and Undercroft) as Limbo while dashing. \nFixed being unable to use the “Switch Gun” input for the Railjack’s Artillery seat. \nFixed the extraction timer resetting after switching to Operator in the extraction zone. \nFixed Saryn’s Molt lingering in the Railjack after completing a mission, which could damage nearby players when it explodes.

enemy AI would not always work as intended for Tomb Guardians. \nFixed a crash occurring during Helene (Saturn) mission on Steel Path.\nFixed Warframe and Operator sometimes posing incorrectly on the login screen, in the Orbiter, and in missions. \nFixed a bug where inviting a pending friend gave a misleading \"user is already a friend\" message.\nFixed a ceiling gap in the Orokin tileset.\nFixed

In this Hotfix, we’ve specifically removed the interaction that buffed its damage, as heavy attacking mid-air is not possible otherwise. We understand that this was a popular combination due to its ability to land wild damage numbers, but it was dependent on a movement animation bug and went beyond the original design for the Arcane. \nFixed players who have not unlocked the Steel Path being able to join Steel Path missions when invited by Host from Dojo. \nFixed several issues with the following weapons when they appear as an offering in Teshin’s Cave: \nFixed the Perla Dual Pistol Skin only being applied to one of the Dex Furis.\nFixed Claw and Fist weapons sitting perpendicular to one another.\nFixed the fist and feet components of Sparring weapons overlapping each other. \nFixed the Tenet Agendus sitting perpendicular to its Shield.\nFixed Ghoulsaw sitting too far to the right in its display.\nFixed several mining locations in the Orb Vallis missing its veins and heat spots (notably at Fortuna Elevator, Deck 12 entrance, and Reflector Control). \nFixed the Vapor Trail K-Drive Mod’s Boost Speed buff being the same (+10) for both Rank 9 and 10.

  "changes": "Echoes Of Duviri: Hotfix 33.6.5:\nHappy TennoCon week, everyone! The team is buzzing with anticipation for the big day on the 26th and we can’t wait to see you. This Hotfix tackles a couple of things we wanted to get out before Saturday, including the Anku Incarnon changes that were mentioned in last week’s Hotfix. See you soon!\nAdded clarification to Anku’s Incarnon Form description and function. Now, successful slide attacks grant +3 Range and inflict guaranteed Bleed Status Procs for all attacks for 6s. \nPreviously, the Anku’s Incarnon form would increase the bias towards Slash damage, but the result was not as impactful as we hoped. Now, this has been replaced with guaranteed Bleed Procs.\nWhile making this change, we found that all melee attacks following a Slide Attack were able to maintain the Incarnon buff (instead of just the intended Slide attack), so long as the attack animations were uninterrupted. We have fixed this issue and incorporated this functionality as a 6s timer, to better facilitate this unintentional, but obviously desirable interaction. So overall, the mechanic is now much more comprehensible and achievable!\nAdded clarification: Some may have noticed that after last week’s Hotfix the description had been changed, but not the functionality \nwhich is now live! \nIncreased Anku’s Evolution II damage buffs for the Edge of Justice and Guardian’s Promise upgrades from +20 to +50. \nUpdated Angstrum’s Incarnon Form description to specify that “direct hits” charge Transmutation, as per the change that went out in last week’s Hotfix. \nFixed the Gammacor Incarnon not clearing its charges when reverting back to its non-Incarnon form.\n\nAdded design credit to community fan artist Illusive19 in the Nihil Recall Glyph’s description.\n\nFixed performance issues (frequent stuttering and a gradual increase in GPU-load) in DirectX 12 playing in Open Landscapes. \nAn automatic rebuilding of the DirectX 12 shader cache will occur over the first few missions, which will cause similar performance issues to occur. But it should remedy itself once the cache is rebuilt.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed Emote Wheel popping up when trying to swap to Fishing or Conservation gear on SteamDeck. \nFixed being unable to exit out of recovering the Paragrimm’s Tomes on SteamDeck. \nFixed cursor remaining on screen while recovering the Paragrimm’s Tomes on SteamDeck. \nFixed Titania remaining in Razorwing form during the extraction animation if triggered as Operator. \nFixed the Warframe selection UI in the second stage of The Duviri Paradox Quest lingering on screen after choosing to return to Orbiter from the pause menu. \nFixed the Shockwave Dojo Decoration being invisible and non-interactive after it has finished building.  \nFixed a wall in the Host’s Landing Craft in the Drifter Camp having no collision and appearing low-res to invited Clients.\nFixed several script errors related to Transference in the Undercroft in the first stage of The Duviri Paradox Quest. To prevent further issues, Transference is now disabled during this Quest stage. \nFixed a script error related to Garv in the Cambion Drift Bounties. \nFixed interacting with your pet in the Dormizone causing them to freeze in place. \nFixed getting stuck infinitely loading in Deck 12. \nFixed Scyto Raknoid jumping into the ceiling and out of the arena in the “Sneaky Sabotage” Break Narmer mission. \nFixed the teleport volumes in the new player tutorial stage of The Duviri Paradox Quest  sending players back to the beginning of the course.\nClick here for the Known Issues List\n",

  "changes": "Echoes Of Duviri: Hotfix 33.6.4:\nThe changes below apply to the base and variant versions of the weapons. Please note that we’re also reviewing the Anku Incarnon for our next Hotfix.\nGammacor:\nCharging the Incarnon Transmutation gauge is now twice as fast!\nIncreased the explosion damage of its Incarnon projectile from 620 to 660 (Synoid from 760 to 800). \nIncreased the Critical Chance bonus from Evolution IV Perk 1 (Critical Parallel) from 18% to 20% (Synoid from 6% to 10%). \nIncreased the Critical Chance from Evolution IV Perk 2 (Survivor's Edge) from 10% to 12% (Synoid from 4% to 6%) and the Status Chance from 6% to 10% (Synoid from 4% to 6%). \nIncreased the Status Chance from Evolution IV Perk 3 (Elemental Balance) from 12% to 20% (Synoid from 6% to 10%).\nAngstrum:\nNow uses direct projectile hits instead of headshots to charge its Incarnon Transmutation gauge. \nThe projectile must physically hit an enemy in order for it to count towards the charge, not the AOE damage dealt to them within proximity of the projectile. \nImproved tracking, speed and targeting of the Incarnon projectiles and added more ricochets off the walls to make it easier for them to land. \nIncreased the Critical Chance bonus from Evolution IV Perk 1 (Critical Parallel) from 10% to 14% (Prisma from 6% to 10%). \nIncreased the Critical and Status Chance bonus from Evolution IV Perk 2 (Survivor's Edge) from 6% to 9% (Prisma from 4% to 6%). \nFixed being unable to reload the Prisma Angstrum after switching to Incarnon Form. \nFixed Angstrum’s Incarnon Form altering the ammo pool of the equipped Primary weapon.\nBoar:\nChanged the way Elemental Balance’s Status Chance bonus (we will be doing the same for Survivor’s Edge in a follow up hotfix) applied to be consistent with the Strun Incarnon: Now it applies to each projectile instead of being divided by the Multishot count.\nPrior to the above change, Elemental Balance’s 12% Status Chance bonus would grant 7.5% \n9% per projectile. Now it grants 7.5% \n19.5% per projectile.\nGorgon:\nRemoved the initial charge delay on Incarnon projectiles fired and replaced it with an automatic trigger type. \nIn other words, you can now hold the fire weapon input to continuously fire its projectiles as long as a charge is available. The former 1.2 second charge delay is its new auto fire rate. \nAdjusted projectile detonation times so that it better matches the fire rate of each variant (base version having the longest and Prisma the quickest).   \nThis goes hand in hand with the two above changes, with the initial charge delay removed and replaced with an automatic trigger there was room to establish a better rhythm for detonation while firing in auto. Instead of many projectiles taking a while to detonate, they will now roughly do so around the next auto shot fired.\nGeneral Incarnon Fixes:\nFixed the Evolution VI Incarnon Challenge (Complete a mission with an Incarnon Weapon in every slot) not completing for the Felarx, Innodem, Laetum, Phenmor and the Praedos when using weapons with Incarnon Geneses installed. \nFixed the Lex Incarnon Genesis’ final evolution challenge (Get 5 Headshots with this weapon in Incarnon form in a single mission) considering headshots from all weapons. \nFixed the Sibear Incarnon Genesis’ Evolution II “Thane’s Wrath” perk missing its UI icon.  \nFixed the “Incarnon Form” text missing from the bottom right UI elements for the Gammacor and Synoid Gammacor while in Incarnon Form.\nPlayer Overguard now protects against Arctic Eximus’ slow auras.  \nOverguard granted by Styanax’s Intrepid Stand Augment Mod is now capped at 15k (at 100% Ability Strength), which scales with Ability Strength. \nOutside of maintaining the status quo (excluding Rhino’s Iron skin, which requires skillful timing to scale), the Augment allowed for infinite amounts of Overguard to be stacked effortlessly and quickly, which could trivialize challenging content and limit future design space. The survivability and team support element that players have been enjoying on Styanax is still preserved, just at a more practical level to encourage more dynamic play.\nOverguard granted by Frost’s Icy Avalanche Augment Mod now stacks on cast (up to 15k, which scales with Ability Strength) instead of keeping the highest value from the original or recast.\nThe following changes have been made to address feedback that the fight feels a tad too challenging on the Steel Path. \nThe Corrupted Jackal Asssassination mission will now appear at stage 4 and onwards in The Circuit to ensure players have had a chance to earn more Decrees before taking it on. \nSlightly reduced Jackal's health and the number of grenades Jackal fires in phases 1 & 2.\nWisp Prime’s cowl cloth has been returned to her helmet instead of her body as intended. As reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1362556-wisp-primes-cowl-cloth-suddenly-attached-to-helmet-instead-of-body/page/3/#comment-12845624\nThe Prisma Ohma is now tradeable!\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed active Warframe Abilities (ex: Voruna’s Ulfrun’s Endurance Augment Mod, Equinox’ Maim, Gauss’ Redline, and Ember’s Immolation) getting deactivated and reset at the end of each Stage in the Circuit. \nThis was caused in our attempt to fix the issue with being able to teleport out of the Undercroft and back into the Duviri landscape using Wisp’s Breach Surge or Wil-O-Wisp in the Echoes of Duviri update. We have reverted that fix in order to address all abilities being affected.  \nFixed melee weapons with projectiles launched from heavy attacks (Glaives, Gunblades, Edun, Argo & Vel, etc.) causing Kullervo’s Wrathful Advance to potentially miss its target. \nFixed dual wielding Glaive and Pistol causing loss of function after casting Kullervo’s Wrathful Advance. \nFixes towards being revived causing the camera to turn 90 degrees after Transference. As reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1361361-transference-after-using-last-gasp-causes-disorienting-camera-movements-fix-pending-cert/\nThis is a workaround non-code solution to address the majority of the camera issues with reviving. A Code fix is still required to fix it in its entirety, which means that you may still encounter it in certain scenarios (e.g. Last Gasp). \nFixed slow loading players being prevented from entering Deck 12 if another player began the fight during the loading process. Those players will now be automatically teleported to the fight upon loading in. \nFixed the Prime Details toggle missing for Wisp Prime while her Dex Skin is equipped.\nFixed the flame VFX missing from Wisp Prime’s Helmet. \nFixed Atlas’ Landslide not increasing the amount of rubble dropped from Petrified enemies by 50% as intended. \nFixed being invisible after closing the game and rejoining the in-progress Orowyrm fight during the Kaithe stage.  \nFixed the new Captura Scenes released with Echoes of Duviri not appearing in Acrithis’ Wares. \nFixed general control binding callouts appearing during The Duviri Paradox Quest instead of the intended Drifter ones. \nFixed incorrect binding callouts appearing during the Drifter combat tutorial in The Duviri Paradox Quest if the “Melee with Fire Weapon Input” option is enabled.  \nFixed controls for the Ludoplex minigames (Frame Fighter, Happy Zephyr, and Wyrmius) not working when using Steam input. \nFixed controls for Komi, Recover the Paragrimm’s Tomes, and the security cameras in Break Narmer missions not working when using Steam input. \nFixed being able to fire weapons during Wisp’s Sol Gate ability after casting it and then immediately following it with Dispensary (Helminth). \nFixed “HUD not initialized” dialog appearing when starting Exterminate and Mobile Defense missions from the Crysalith elevator. \nAlso fixed the enemy kill count to not displaying correctly in Exterminate missions under the same start condition. \nFixed stealth melee kills not counting towards the “Close Up Kills” Break Narmer challenge (Kill 3 enemies with melee). \nFixed Grineer allies disappearing after dying and respawning in the “Junk Run” and “Prison Break” Break Narmer missions.\nFixed an error popup (“You must complete the Vox Solaris Quest”) preventing players from speaking to Eudico after returning from the Orb Vallis during stage 5 of the Vox Solaris Quest. \nFixed the Wisp Prime Skin icon in the Arsenal appearing as a blank square. \nFixed shields (from Sword and Shield Melee weapons) sitting backwards on Baruuk’s arm when his Doan Skin is equipped.  \nFixed the Protovyre Apex Syandana clipping into the Drifter Keeler Suit. \nFixed offset issues with the Left Prisma Daedalus Shoulder Guard when equipped onto the Drifter Keeler Suit. \nFixed the right Emblem offset being too far forward on all Limbo skins when equipped on Limbo Prime.  \nFixed several offset issues with leg attachments equipped on Kullervo. \nFixed offset issues with chest attachments equipped on the Drifter Saita Prime Suit. \nFixed offset issues with the Imugi Prime Shoulder Plate equipped on Gauss. \nFixed offset issues with shoulder attachments equipped on the Nova Atomica Skin. \nFixed being unable to equip the Balefire Einheri skin on Hildryn’s Balefire Prime. \nFixed the Cognitive Relay Facial Accessory sitting weirdly on the Duviri Drifter. \nFixed the Demolyst’s beep SFX at times slightly offset if in a far away room.\nFixed the Syam, Azothane, Edun, and Sampotes missing several SFX with various Melee Stances. \nFixed an issue with the sample used for Sevagoth’s Sow SFX. \nFixed the Bronco Prime not leaving bullet holes in the environment. \nFixed a rare bug where Nihil’s health bar could go missing. \nFixed several HUD script errors related to the Nihil fight. \nFixed double spacing in the Wisp Prime Accessories Pack. \nFixed a crash that could occur if Host returned to a town hub before Client managed to get into the open landscape. \nFixed a rare crash when going from town to landscape and failing to connect.\nFixes towards being unable to chat link several Kavat and Kubrow Fur Patterns. \nFixed being unable to chat link the 2023 Pride items and the Pride Celebration Color Palette. \nFixed text appearing cut off in the in-game Market after opening a chat link. \nFixed being able to equip Primary weapons in the Dojo after using the Shawzin emote. \nFixed the Accessibility Color Palette not being available in the Customize HUD Colors screen if accessed in-mission. \nFixed Kahl (summoned from Skaut’s “Kahl Beacon” Air Support) not shooting when commanded to hold position.\nClick here for the Known Issues List\n",

  "changes": "Click Here To Share Feedback And Bug Reports In The Dedicated Sub-Forums:\n\nEchoes of Duviri is a Mainline Update!\nMeaning that everything the team has been working on since the launch of The Seven Crimes of Kullervo is in this update (with the obvious exception of content that is not ready to be released). It is very likely, as it is with all Mainline updates, that things can slip through the cracks so we will be looking at reports here for any fixes and changes for follow-up Hotfixes to come.\nIf any of the terms above are new to you, visit “The Warframe Lexicon for Updates” to learn more about Warframe’s development cycle.\nPlease visit our \"Known Issues\" thread for an update on the top priority bugs and issues we are currently tracking.\n\n\n* Players can equip or unequip this Shroud on Wisp Prime as an Auxiliary attachment.\n\nNow that Wisp Prime Access is available, the following items have been added to the Prime Vault for a future Prime Resurgence rotation. If you have Relics that contain these items they will remain in your Inventory.\nNidus Prime\nStrun Prime\nMagnus Prime\nWith this Vaulting comes the shift of the following Syndicate Sacrifices:\nReplaced Rank 4 The Perrin Sequence sacrifice of Magnus Prime Barrel with Knell Prime Barrel. \nReplaced Rank 5 Steel Meridian sacrifice of Nidus Prime Neuroptics with Garuda Prime Neuroptics. \nReplaced Rank 5 New Loka sacrifice of Nidus Prime Neuroptics with Garuda Prime Neuroptics.\nAs with each round of Prime Access come updated Riven Disposition numbers, but we have taken a different approach for this update and have postponed Disposition decreases \ncheck the full details here:\n\nPurchase the Collection in the in-game Market or purchase each individual Visage Ink from the Drifter Appearance tab.\nGain instant access to the Argo & Vel for both Drifter and Warframes with Platinum from Teshin’s Cave or the in-game Market. Or unlock it with Pathos Clamps for Drifter use and gain its blueprint to craft in the Foundry for Warframe use.\n\nIn order for the expected time to complete Assassination to stay in line with other game modes, the Jackal fight has been modified from its original form on Venus. Jackal in the Undercroft will have three phases instead of four, and will be protected by reinforcements between phases.\nOn defeat, Jackal will drop Rune Marrow and has a chance to drop the Jackal Sigil.\nTrauma Clamps are hazards that can be found throughout the Undercroft. Breaking them open will pull in both Tenno and their foes alike, trapping them for a moment and imparting effects determined by the current Spiral. The range at which players will be drawn in is smaller than that of your enemies, but still take care when activating them. Use these strategically, as only a few spawn per Undercroft Tile. However, as the Void does work in mysterious ways, there is a chance of further Trauma Clamps spawning after a hazard is unleashed.\n\nThrax’s Spirals will augment Trauma Clamps with the following effects:\nSorrow: Cold Damage and Status\nAnger: Heat Damage and Status\nFear: Electricity Damage and Status\nEnvy: Toxin Damage and Status\nJoy: Void Damage and Status, plus healing that will seek out nearby players.\n\nNew Incarnon Geneses are being added to the Circuit Steel Path reward path! Once acquired, players can install them into the applicable weapons by visiting Cavalero on the Zariman.\nHere is the updated Offering Rotation Schedule for the Steel Path Circuit:\nAs previously discussed on Devstream 172, the intention behind this experiment is to offer players the option to pay-to-skip should they desire, while ensuring that the free acquisition path is not prohibitive for players. Only these 5 new items will be available for Platinum via this experiment, and will become available following the Weekly Reset on July 30th.\n\nBrand new Warframe Augment Mods are available from Syndicates Offerings!\n*Stats below are shown at Max Rank.\nAvailable in the Arbiters of Hexis and The Perrin Sequence offerings.\nAvailable in The Perrin Sequence and Cephalon Suda offerings.\nAvailable in the Red Veil and Steel Meridian offerings.\nAvailable in the New Loka and Arbiters of Hexis offerings.\nValues marked with an asterisk* can be stacked and are shown at max.\n\nUndercroft Dax Camp Scene\nUndercroft Lodging Scene\nUndercroft Lunaro Scene\nUndercroft Township Scene\nUndercroft Outskirts Scene\nCrater Cay Scene\nDais Cay Scene\nWinding Isles Scene\nLittle Cay Scene\nBasin Cay Scene\nImage above shows view of the entry to the Harbringer’s Pass Dojo Room.\nImage above shows a view of the inside of the Courtier’s Bliss Dojo Room.\nDue to the unique nature of these rooms, only one of each can be placed in your Dojo.\n\nEnhanced Damage Numbers\nOverguard for Warframes\nCold, Impact, and Puncture Status Changes\nFor our visual learning Tenno, take a look at the Enhanced Damage Numbers in action with Lead Game Designer Pablo!\n\nOverall Damage Number Changes:\nWhether you are using Legacy or Enhanced Damage Numbers, these new settings will be available with Echoes of Duviri:\nDamage Number Scale\nCustom scaling of your damage number text size, from 50 to 300!\nAdditionally, Damage numbers will no longer scale with HUD scale setting as they used to. So you can customize the HUD and the numbers separately.\n\nCompact Damage Numbers\nThis Toggle will shorten large numbers for legibility (i.e. 100,357 would be shortened to 100k)\nEnhanced Damage Numbers Setting\nWith this new setting toggled on, players can expect to see the following:\nRefreshed Damage Number Appearance\nA punchier presentation of damage numbers, with an updated font treatment to improve legibility. For reference of what this looks like in action, refer to Pablo’s video above.\nPrioritized Critical Hits\nPlayer damage output varies wildly from damage over time (DOT) from Status Effects to powerful Critical Hits. Previously all types of Damage were treated the same in the Damage Number cycle: meaning, Critical Hit Damage Numbers often disappeared quickly if there were a lot of small DOT procs happening concurrently. From a gameplay side, this had no impact on the actual damage done to your enemies, but it meant the true impact of your Critical Hits was not always communicated to you as clearly as we would like.\nCustom Ability Damage Treatment\nSince your Abilities traditionally cannot Crit, these attacks tend to have less oomph. Now Ability Damage has its own Damage Color so that it will stand out amongst the rest!\nLike all other Damage Numbers, you can customize Ability Damage colors in the “Customize Hud Colors” menu (found in the Interface category of your Accessibility Settings).\n\nMelee Damage Numbers\nWith Legacy settings, Damage Numbers appear at the point of contact, often off-screen or otherwise obstructed by Melee attacks.\nWith Enhanced settings, Melee Damage numbers will now travel with you to improve visibility and will travel with the attack movement as well. Again, this is best illustrated in Pablo’s video for those who want to see this in action!\nNow that players have access to Overguard consistently, we have made some adjustments to improve the quality of life in this new health state:\nConsistent Proc Immunity\nDue to the variety of sources of Overguard, there were occasionally inconsistencies in how it behaved in regard to Proc Immunity. With Echoes of Duviri, all sources of Player Overguard will offer Full Proc Immunity while active.\nOverguard Depletion Protection\nSimilar to Shields, Player Overguard will now offer a brief moment of invulnerability (currently 0.5s) once depleted. This window will prevent players with Overguard from being one-shot, as damage to Overguard will no longer carry over into your Health or Shield pool once depleted.\nUpon launch, we will closely monitor feedback on this mechanic change to see if further adjustments are needed.\nNOTE: This Overguard Depletion Protection applies only to Player Overguard, not Overguard seen on enemies.\nHit Impact Visuals \nSimilar to taking damage to your Health or your Shields, Overguard now has its own unique appearance when attacked. Damage will no longer cause blood splatters while Overguard is active, and we have added a unique metallic hit effect that better communicates having a layered shell protecting you.\nAdditionally, players will no longer flinch while taking damage with Overguard active. \n(NOTE: This has no gameplay function other than looking cool)\nPuncture Changes:\nWeakened Status Effect Buffs:\nIncreased the debuff to enemy attacks from 30% to 40% on the first stack.\nReduced the maximum amount of stacks from 10 to 5.\nIncreased per-stack debuff from 5% to 10%. \nIncreased the total debuff at Max Stacks from 75% to 80%.\nWeakened Status Effect Additions:\nIncreases Critical Chance threshold on enemy by 5% per Stack, to a maximum of 25% at 5 Stacks. This is additive after mods, not before. Does not apply to Abilities or AOE damage.\nImpact Changes:\nStagger Status Effect Changes:\nReduced the maximum amount of stacks from 10 to 5.\nIncreased the Mercy Threshold from 4% to 8% per stack.\nFunctionally, this allows for players to trigger early Mercy kills with less stacks required!\nNOTE: These changes should not affect the functionality of Impact Stacks for Mods such as Internal Bleeding or Hemorrhage.\nCold Changes:\nFreeze Status Effect Changes:\nIncreased the maximum amount of stacks from 8 to 9.\nIncreased the additional per-stack Slow from 3.5% to 5%. \nIncreased the maximum Slow effect from 75% to 90%. \nWhile we previously mentioned buffing Cold Slow Effect to 85% in our Citrine’s Last Wish update, we mistakenly only increased it to 75% instead.\nFreeze Status Effect Additions:\nIncreased the Critical Damage taken by an enemy by 10% on initial Status Effect Subsequent Stacks increase this debuff by 5%, up to a maximum of 50%. This is additive after mods, not before.\n\nUpdated the Duviri Steel Path access message to properly indicate what nodes must be completed to access the Steel Path, as previously announced in this PSA. \nRemoved the Duviri Starting Path from the New Player Experience. Now, all new Tenno will start with the Vor's Prize Quest, and the Duviri Paradox will be available to them after its completion. \nAfter months of review of player behavior, we are making this change to give all new players an accurate representation of core Warframe gameplay before we introduce them to the magic of Duviri.  Offering two Starting Paths for new players was an experiment -\nand not one we regret -\nbut a key part of experimentation is continued iteration after the fact to ensure the best player experience possible. Tenno who already chose the Drifter Path should not be affected!\nRemoved a Dax Arcus spawn point in Castle Town that could bother players visiting Acrithis after the Orowrym fight. \nPathos Clamps, Kullervo’s Bane, and Steel Essence will now appear in the reward banner that appears at the top of the screen in Duviri instead of sliding in from the side. \nUpdated the waypoint marker functionality when retrieving the Orvius from the Rablit in the Orowyrm fight. Upon approaching the area where the Rablit spawns, a new waypoint will appear on the Rablit directly, telling you where to grab your Orvius from!\nAdded improvements to the area marker for the “Hidden Chest” objective to help guide players to the Chest. The area marker will shrink as time passes, and will disappear entirely once the Chest is found.\nImproved the transition from Paragrimm back to Drifter after completing the “Recover the Paragrimm’s Tomes” Objective. Now, the screen will fade to black during the transition, and the Tome on the Paragrimm's pedestal will no longer glow once the objective is completed.\nMissed note: Removed Luscinia’s Opera singing in the Undercroft. \nDue to the smaller tile, the singing was easily triggered a lot with players crossing paths with it often which created a lot of auditory noise. \nEnable Hint Transmissions toggle in your Audio Settings will now also apply to non-critical game mode transmissions in the Undercroft. When toggled off, Teshin will wax a little less poetic about Void Angels and choose instead to watch your progress silently from afar.\nThe Duviri Shawzin screen will now auto-close after completing the song and earning the side objective reward. Re-entering the Shawzin screen after the initial completion will not automatically exit you out for any further songs you play. \nThis change was made to remove the awkward waiting period after finishing your song before you earned your Decree. Now it will automatically close once your Decree is earned, and you can simply interact with the Shawzin again if you wish to continue your jam session.\n\nModular Components that can earn Mastery will now show if that component is Mastered when viewed in a Vendor Menu (ex: viewing Zaw Strikes at Hok).\nReduced the intensity of camera static effect when using Security Cameras in Break Narmer missions. As per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1359305-khal-sneaky-sabotage-bugs-wc-3-july-2023/?ct=1688389719  \nImproved the visibility of Cortege’s beam when using a black energy color with lower GPU Particle Quality settings. \nKullervo will now turn to face the direction of the reticle when casting Collective Curse while stationary.  \nAdjusted Kullervo’s Wrathful Advance teleport to accommodate for his melee attack movement, meaning players are less likely to slide right past enemies. \nImproved the transition between the death and ragdoll animations to be more natural and smooth. Also improved enemies getting up and recovering from a ragdolled state. \nSlightly smoothed and improved the Rifle aiming animation. \nPlayer HUD and Chat scale values now change based on chosen video resolution if those settings are set to the default values, or if you are starting the game for the first time.\nIncreased the IPS (Impact, Puncture, Slash) Damage of the following Mods: \nRupture \nIncreased Impact Damage from 30% to 90% \nDisruptor \nIncreased Impact Damage from 30% to 90%\nPiercing Hit \nIncreased Puncture Damage from 30% to 90% \nFlechette \nIncreased Puncture Damage  from 30% to 90% \nSawtooth Clip \nIncreased Slash Damage from 30% to 90%\nShredder \nIncreased Slash Damage from 30% to 90%\nConcussion Rounds \nIncreased Impact Damage from 60% to 90%\nNo Return \nIncreased Puncture Damage from 60% to 90%\nRazor Shot \nIncreased Slash Damage from 60% to 90%\nUpdated the Incarnon Form transformation animations for the Dual Toxocyst. \nUpdated the Conservation animal map icons to match their respective Echo Lure colors. \n \nUpdated the Platinum and Regal Aya purchase screens to be more streamlined. \nCommon Cambion Drift resources (Ganglion, Lucent Teroglobes, and Pustulite) no longer trigger the special resource notification when picked up in the landscape. \nThese special resource notifications are meant to highlight uncommon or rare pick-ups in-mission. Players will still be able to see common Cambion Drift resources via the regular resource pick-up notification -\nwe’re just saving that special pop-up for harder to find items! \nRemoved a feature where certain bosses scaled their level based on your equipped Mods.\nThis is a remnant of an older Warframe system that scaled difficulty based on your Mod loadout. As a result, enemies like Captain Vor might be anywhere from level 10 to 30, depending on how “powerful” your equipped Mods were during your encounter. \nWith this feature removed, now all bosses will always spawn at a consistent level on the regular Star Chart.\nIncreased the size of the Polychrome context action so that it's more accessible at odd angles.\nBlitz Eximus will no longer target Defense Targets with their shockwave attack, but the Defense Target can still be injured by it if hit.\n\nImplemented experimental cached shader prefetch for DirectX 12 to reduce hitches and visual pops. This may also reduce load-times because it moves shader compiling earlier in the loading process and may avoid the loading screen waiting for the driver. \nNote: Because this changes the shader cache format it will take some time to reach maximum performance as you rebuild your cache (this is typically required after a large update since shaders need to be reached, even for DirectX 11).\nMade experimental optimizations for processors with hybrid architectures (eg: 12th Gen Intel). \nOptimized small hitches in DirectX 12 that could occur when transmissions or menus with 3D backgrounds appeared. \nMade micro-optimizations to memory footprint in the resource system to save over 70 KB. \nMade micro-optimizations to engine startup and level loading. \nMade systemic micro-optimizations to level loading for all platforms. \nMade optimizations to sound pathing. \nMade systemic micro-optimizations to rendering performance. \nMade optimizations to level loading. \nMade systemic micro-optimizations to the content update system.\nMade small performance fixes when playing The Duviri Paradox Quest.\n\n",

  "fixes": "Fixed Defense waves resetting after Host migration in the Undercroft. \nFixed Kullervo’s Recompense being able to put him in bleed-out if Ability Strength is high. \nOther Warframes with a Health cost mechanic, such as Garuda and Inaros, prevent their self-damage from going beyond 2 Health. Kullervo’s Recompense now also has this preventative measure. \nFixed extremely high damage numbers caused by the Fortifying Will Decree interacting with Armor buffing abilities (e.g. Rhino’s Iron Skin and Chroma’s Elemental Ward/Vex Armor). \nFortifying Will grants 15% (at max) Ability Strength for every 50 Armor, which was creating an endless feedback loop with Armor buffing abilities and causing extreme numbers to be reached (at times reaching the billions). In order to fix the above and prevent any further issues, Fortifying Will now has a 500% Ability Strength cap. We want players to continue to enjoy the power that Decrees grant without exceeding levels that are game breaking. With the change above, we have also fixed the following issues: \nFixed the aforementioned abilities not working at all after several casts. \nFixed infinite and permanent armor stacking gained from casting Rhino’s Charge back to back with the Ironclad Charge Augment Mod equipped.\nFixed always getting the same Arcane (and possibly the same resource) from all available side objective Undercroft Portals in The Duviri Experience. \nFixed Last Gasp UI and VFX lingering for Clients after getting teleported out of the Undercroft. \nAlso fixed instant death upon using Transference Surge once returned to the Duviri Landscape. \nFixed being stuck as Warframe in Duviri if teleported from the Undercroft lobby to the Kullervo fight in The Duviri Experience. \nTo address the above and prevent any further issues, the Kullervo fight cannot be started until after all players have returned from the Undercroft. A warning message will appear to inform players if that is the case. \nFixed unranked Arcane Power Ramp giving 100x more Ability Strength than was intended (+2%, stacking up to 4x).  \nFixed Dragon Keys not unequipping from loadout and affecting gameplay in The New War Quest. \nMore fixes towards FOV randomly resetting after certain Duviri objectives.\nFixed Clients losing Sirocco after returning to the Duviri Landscape after defeating the Orowyrm. \nFixed mirrored Operator in Ghost Mirror side objectives spawning in unreachable places if the encounter began while flying above it. \nMore fixes towards launcher-related issues: \nFixes towards the launcher crashing upon hitting  “Play.” \nFixes towards crashing on launcher startup. \nFixes towards the launcher going all black. \nMore fixes towards a crash that could occur after changing some Upscaling settings and starting the game with DirectX 12.\nMore fixes towards rare crashes that would occur on laptops with both an Nvidia RTX GPU and an Intel IGP. \nFixed Drifter Melee weapon being invisible upon returning to the Duviri landscape from the Undercroft if an automatic weapon was being fired at the time the player was teleported. \nFixed the Config screen in Teshin’s Cave only showing the weapon/Warframe’s base stats (not appearing affected by Mods).\nFixed installing Forma reverting previously modified Configs. For example: Changes to Config A would revert after adjusting Config B and then installing a Forma. \nFixed the Bo, Strun, and Vasto (base and variants) Incarnon’s Evolution IV challenge description not stating that it requires “slide attacks” to complete. \nWas: Kill X enemies with this weapon.\nNow: Kill X enemies with slide attacks. \nFixed several elements of the Enigma at Kullervo’s Hold not functioning (i.e. Glyphs missing from totem), making it impossible to complete. \nFixed the Felarx Incarnon’s Evolution V challenge description appearing as a file path. \nFixes towards Drifter’s Guiding Hand ability not guiding anywhere if cast while airborne. \nFixed loss of function from changing tabs in the Crew Contracts screen of the Configure Railjack console. \nFixed blinding VFX occurring when dual wielding the Furis Incarnon with a Glaive weapon. \nFixed issue where Decree SFX could get cut abruptly.  \nFixed certain elements of the Enigma located in Kullervo’s Hold not working. \nFixed permanent black screen caused by spawning Kaithe immediately after interacting with the Find the Paragrimm’s Tomes side objective in Duviri. \nFixed Undercroft Portal VFX causing them to appear active during the Orowyrm fight when they were indeed not. \nFixed the context action to interact with Kullervo’s bulletins appearing while riding Kaithe. \nSince it cannot be interacted with from Kaithe, it won’t appear until after you dismount. \nFixed a brief flash of brightness in the end of the mission screen. \nFixed Corpus Coildrives in the Orb Vallis not moving until players get close.\nFixed the Nikana Krtrima Skin's tooltip in the in-game Market's Featured tab stating that you do not own Nikanas even when you do. \nMore fixes towards offset issues with the Drifter Saita Prime Suit. \nMore fixes towards armor offset issues with the Drifter Harrier Suit (notably the Protovyre Shoulder Armor, TennoCon 2019 Shoulder Plates, and Sorex Shoulder Guards). \nFixes towards the portal in Teshin’s Cave at times not appearing. \nFixed security camera VFX not being culled through walls. \nFixed a crash related to processing in the Undercroft. \nFixed a crash caused by Host migration during the Kullervo Fight. \nFixed the in-game Market “Show All” label for Premium Bundles on the Featured page indicating there were more Bundles than what is actually available. \nFixed rare crash related to the Kullervo boss fight. \nFixed rare crash that could occur when the Ghoul Devourer uses its abilities.\nFixed several script errors in the Ghost Mirror side objective in Duviri. \nFixed a script error in the first stage of The Duviri Paradox Quest. \nFixed a script error caused by Khora’s Venari. \nFixed a script error caused by Kullervo’s Recompense. \nFixed a script error in the UI. \nFixed a script error caused by attempting to join a mission and losing internet connection at the same time.\n\n",

  "additions": "Starting today with the release of Kullervo in this Update, each new Warframe we release from this point on will increase the number of purchasable loadout slots by 1.\nWith Kullervo, we’ve updated the number from 20 to 21.  \nTeshin’s Cave offerings can now be previewed in the Star Chart before entering Duviri with the Rank 4 “Warframe Abundance” Opportunity Drifter Intrinsic unlocked.\nThe display will also show the amount of Forma installed on the active offerings.\nAdded ability to fully customize Drifter controls in the settings. Select the Customize Key Bindings option under the Keyboard/Mouse section.and navigate over to the Drifter tab. \nAdded a “Complete” icon to the mini and detailed maps in Duviri after completing main and side objectives. \nAdded “The Steel Path” option to the Simulacrum enemy settings.

  "changes": "Click Here To Share Feedback And Bug Reports In The Dedicated Sub-Forums:\n\n\nMeaning that everything the team has been working on since the launch of The Duviri Paradox is in this update (with the obvious exception of content that is not ready to be released). It is very likely, as it is with all Mainline updates, that things can slip through the cracks so we will be looking at reports here for any fixes and changes for follow-up Hotfixes to come.\nIf any of the terms above are new to you, visit “The Warframe Lexicon for Updates” to learn more about Warframe’s development cycle.\n\nBut first, you must learn what lies ahead before engaging in a tangle of blades with this mystifying convict.\nDueling Kullervo will be a test of all that you have learned in Duviri. Use the skills and Drifter Intrinsics honed by your blade to battle your way to glory against this formidable master of knives. Evade ranged attacks, vengeful backstabs, and unblockable strikes if you wish to survive the onslaught of this tortured warrior. Tenno will need to parry, counter, and rely on their wits if they wish to escape Kullervo’s Hold with their lives intact.\nIf you have yet to fight the Orowyrm to earn Pathos Clamps in Duviri, now is the time! This time-limited node is our way of encouraging players to experience and complete a full Spiral in Duviri if they have yet to do so. Duviri has much to offer, and Kullervo awaits your visitation for a dance of blades.\n\nSuccessfully defeating Kullervo and the Orowyrm will reward you handsomely (listed below).\nFighting Kullervo in The Lone Story:\nDefeating Kullervo has a chance of being one of the Spiral stages to complete during the Anger, Fear and Sorrow Spirals. If it does, it will occur in the second half of the stages so that players have accumulated at least 3 Decrees before fighting him.\nFighting Kullervo in The Duviri Experience:\nIn addition to fighting Kullervo as a main Spiral Stage, players can also voluntarily start the fight as a side objective during the Anger, Fear and Sorrow Spirals.\n\nWrathful Advance is Kullervo’s Helminth ability with diminished Range and Melee Critical Chance increase.\n*Overguard is a defense mechanic that was made available to Warframes with The Duviri Paradox. While active, it grants additional Health protection and provides Knockdown Immunity.\nStorm of Ukko is Kullervo’s Railjack ability.\nPurchase Kullervo from the in-game Market for instant access or earn it by fighting him in Kullervo’s Hold to earn Kullervo’s Bane to spend at Acrithis’ Wares.\nHis health increases for each additional member in the squad. He must be defeated to successfully complete the Undercroft mission.\nOn defeat, Captain Vor will drop Rune Marrow and has a chance to drop the Vor Sigil.\nSlightly reduced the number of enemies required to exterminate (scales with number of players in squad).\nReduced waves from 5 to 3. \nIn an effort to decrease the length of Defense missions in the Undercroft, we’ve opted to reduce the number of waves to complete.\nIncreased enemy spawns and added Eximus units to defeat at the end of the mission. \nWith the wave reduction, we want to maintain a level of challenge throughout the mission by ending it with a bang. \nThe Defense Target will now regenerate its Shields to full in between waves. \nIn light of the increase in enemy spawns and the addition of Eximus units, we wanted to ensure the target wasn’t in any immediate danger of being destroyed right on wave reset.\nSlightly reduced drop rate of Life Support capsules from enemies.\nSince Undercroft Survival does not last longer than 5 minutes, it does not need to use the same rules that let players stay indefinitely in an endless Origin System’s Survival mission. As long as players are killing enemies and activating Life Support towers when needed, this shouldn’t cause any problems!\n*Stats shown at max rank\n\nDuring your time in Duviri, you have ventured into many Undercroft portals as part of the Spiral stages. Now, you can enter the Undercroft as a Side Objective in The Duviri Experience!\nOutside of the portals that spawn for Spiral stages, there will always be a total of 3 side objective portals available in Duviri. They spawn at different locations each visit! Approaching these portals will mark them on your map while you are in relative proximity to them so that you can return if you are unable to conquer them immediately.\n\nRequirement to enter: You must acquire 7 Decrees before entering The Undercroft! The reason being so that you are fully prepared for the challenges that await on the other side of the portal. These side objective portals are disabled when a main Spiral stage requires you enter a designated portal. Note that the Rank 3 Opportunity Intrinsic “Lucky Opener” which grants a free Decree upon entering Duviri does not count towards the 7 Decrees needed to enter.\nDifficulty: \nEnemies in these side objective Undercroft portals are much more challenging than your average Spiral stage portal.\nOnce you have completed the Undercroft mission, the portal then becomes deactivated \nsimilar to other side objectives once completed.\nRewards: \nCompletion of a side objective Undercroft Portal rewards the following:\n\nHow to Kaithe Race: \nStart the race by entering the first gate, once crossed the timer countdown begins! Clear all of the required gates to complete the race. Each successful gate crossed adds 3 seconds to the time to complete the race. Shooting the targets also grants 3 seconds of additional time. There is no penalty for skipping gates, but you do miss out on gaining those extra seconds!\n\n\nKaithe Racing Rewards: \nSuccessfully completing a Kaithe race rewards Drifter Intrinsics, a Decree and Duviri resources. The more players from the squad join into the race and complete it, the better the rewards are for the whole team!\n\nRecover the Paragrimm’s Tomes Rewards:\nFinding all of the required targets will reward Duviri resources, Drifter Intrinsics, and a Decree.\nLost Belongings Rewards:\nCollecting all of the Lost Belongings will reward Duviri resources, Drifter Intrinsics, and a Decree!\n\n\nDiscover new Decree combinations to take your Drifter and Warframe loadouts to the next level.\nValues marked with an asterisk* can be stacked and are shown at max.\nDrifter Melee Power Strikes and Warframe Melee Ground Slams now benefit from damage buffs from Decrees. \nFixed cases where an “On damage” Decree would cancel out the ability to trigger another “On damage” Decree if both were triggered in the same instance. \nFor example: Critical Frost grants an extra instance of Cold Damage when you score a critical hit, and Bombastines Malice delivers area of effect Toxin Damage on a headshot. If both were active and you got a critical headshot on an enemy while Critical Frost was triggered, Bombastine’s Malice wouldn’t have a chance to inflict area of effect Toxin Damage. \nFixed the Decree selection UI always showing the default controller binding regardless of the current assignment. \nFixed the “Reroll Decree” button appearing before the Decrees appear on screen. \nIt will now appear slightly after the Decrees appear to avoid accidentally clicking it before the selections are visible. \nFixed hearing the “Decree earned” SFX when mounting Kaithe with unselected Decrees.\nFixed the “Proficient Fighter” Decree’s (Drifter Ability cooldown reduced by 45%*. Warframes gain +45%* Ability Efficiency.) cooldown reduction being doubled for the first two stacks. \nFixed being unable to reload or fire the Hema with the Rolling Reload Decree selected.\n\nThe growth timer resets once you collect the resources from Teshin’s Cave. Check back once the plants have matured again to harvest, rinse repeat! The resources harvested can immediately be used to purchase wares from Acrithis if you happen to come across her in the Duviri Landscape. For the launch of this update, the plants are already fully matured and waiting for you to collect them.\nIf you enter Teshin’s Cave with a squad, each individual squad member has access to their own plants and will see their growth progress.\n\nDuviri Fainting Couch \nDuviri Theater Seat\nDuviri Repast Table\nDuviri Mortis Stela \nDuviri Modesty Screen\nDuviri Hand Spa\nDuviri Senate Seat\nDuviri Hay Bale\nDuviri Footstool \nDuviri Lectern \nDuviri Clerical Desk \nDuviri Calculum \nDuviri Scales\nLike the Watchful Paragrimm decoration, these wares will be available perpetually, without a rotating schedule. This way you can see what items are tradeable for Enigma Gyrum and save up accordingly.\n\nUeymag Barb can also appear in the Normal and Steel Path Circuit reward paths.\nThere are 10 new Somachord songs you can unlock by collecting their fragments in Duviri:\nBelow The Thunder\nUnbound\nDrifter’s Respite\nParagrimm Ascending\nPerdition’s Coils\nShadows And Summonings\nHe Who Waits\nInto Madness\nEyes That Burn\nDuviri Paradox\nThe Somachord has also been added to your Dormizone! Play your newly found Duviri tunes in the comfort of your Zariman domain.\n\n\n\n\nNikana Krtrima Skin by kakarrot812\nKrtrima Chest Armor by kakarrot812\nKrtrima Leg Armor by kakarrot812\nKrtrima Shoulder Armor by kakarrot812\n\nLiset Herulyst Skin by LostEpoch\nNekros Ausirylyst Skin and Helmet by LostEpoch\nVikasa Aegis Chest Armor by blazingcobalt \nZhivira Shoulder Armor by blazingcobalt\n\n\n*Raven Drifter is seen in the above image.\nAny player purchasing these Operator cosmetics in the future will automatically receive the matching Drifter variants as well. For those of you that already own these coveted collections, the Drifter versions will be available immediately in your inventory via an account update on log-in.\n\nComplete a mission stage in the Steel Path Circuit.\nComplete a full Spiral in The Duviri Experience (ie. defeating the Orowyrm)\nComplete a full Spiral in The Lone Story (ie. defeating the Orowyrm)\nSelect the “Evolve Incarnon Weapons” option and then the weapon you wish to remove the Incarnon Genesis from. The new “Remove Incarnon'' option is available upon selecting an eligible Incarnon Weapon via the Evolution screen from Cavalero.\n\nReduced the individual stages of each Spiral from 6 to 3 objectives.\nShuffled the objectives in the Spiral stages to help with overall quest flow. The Quest stages are now as follows: \nANGER\nDefeat the Dax \nOpen Chest and defeat its Guardian\nUndercroft Exterminate \nJOY\nConquer the Maze\nPurge the darkened areas of Liminus \nUndercroft Survival \nENVY \nReconnect the Power Lines \nDefeat the high ground Dax \nUndercroft Defense \nReduced the amount of repeated actions needed to complete the Drifter Combat tutorial.\nUpdated the SFX of the first dialogue line during The Covetous Courtier stage of The Duviri Paradox Quest. \nSmall animation polish for the opening cutscene of The Duviri Paradox Quest.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed Shawzin and Maw Feeding locations being highlighted despite being unavailable during the Quest. \nFixed a rare crash that could occur when parrying the Dax Gladius during the Drifter Combat tutorial (Defeat the Dax).\nFixed the Drifter not removing their hood when sitting down for a meal of protein cubes during the Zariman section of the Quest.\nAnd here we thought the Drifter had basic table manners…\nFixed rare issue where players would be unable to progress past the first stage in The Duviri Paradox Quest if they did not pick up the Sirocco before heading towards the bridge. \nThis was causing the Kaithe not to spawn to traverse the bridge to continue onto the next stages. \nFixed a rogue Guiding Hand wisp and objective marker appearing in the sky in The Duviri Paradox Quest after the bridge crumbles in the first stage. \nFixed the last enemy killed in the “Prove your command of Warframe Abilities” stage of The Duviri Paradox Quest vanishing immediately on death.\nFixed choosing “Stay” after completing The Duviri Paradox Quest causing all of the Warframe offerings in Teshin’s Cave to appear as Excalibur. Also fixes being unable to select a Warframe at all. \nFixed being unable to swap weapons in The Duviri Paradox Quest after exiting an Undercroft stage. \nFixed getting flung forward after dismounting Kaithe when approaching Bombastine in the first stage of the Duviri Paradox Quest. \nAlso fixed Kaithe ending up underground afterwards.\nFixed enemy spawns being too low to complete the Undercroft Exterminate mission during the “The Prince of Fire” stage in The Duviri Paradox Quest. \nFixed the Undercroft Survival mission objective UI lingering on the screen after failing it in The Duviri Paradox Quest. \nFixed the wrong controller button callout for how to dodge in The Duviri Paradox Quest.\n\nOverguard as a Warframe defense mechanism was introduced in Drifter Intrinsics and Decrees with The Duviri Paradox update \nit grants additional Health protection and provides Knockdown Immunity while active.\nOverguard has virtually the same function (Health buffs and immunities*) as the listed abilities and Augment Mods, so in an effort to expose the mechanic more and establish familiarity with Overguard as a whole (as it also appears on enemies) we have made it the visual indicator for them.\n*The base defensive properties of these abilities and Augment Mods have not changed!\nThis change also has the added benefit of allowing “On Damaged” Mods and Arcanes to apply to all of the above! Prior to this change, the aforementioned abilities would make the player \"invulnerable\" until the added survivability was depleted. Now, Mods and Arcanes like Adaptation and Arcane Avenger can now be triggered when damage is taken to Overguard, because it is treated similarly to Health and Shields.\nThe HUD Overguard element has also had slight upgrades for the purposes of registering for these abilities and Augment Mods:\n*GIF above shows Iron Skin cast.\nPart of this process includes the following changes:\nOverhauled which stats are prioritized on which weapon types. \nMods with universal benefits (like increased damage and multishot) are equipped first, while attempting to equip mods that benefit the weapon type (like critical and status increases) if the base stats are high enough.\nMade Auto Install consider equipping unveiled Riven Mods depending on their stats.\nMade Warframe Aura selection use its own prioritization system when choosing what to install.\nOther Auto Install Fixes:\nFixed an issue where Auto Install tried to equip veiled Riven mods if there was space.\nFixed Auto Install prioritizing “conditional” mods that only triggered under special circumstances.\n\nNVIDIA RTX Minimum Driver Version Requirement: 512.15\nEnabling and picking an upscaling quality level will fix the internal rendering resolution to a smaller size. This is then later upscaled using a temporal algorithm, meaning it's using information from previous frames, just like with temporal anti-aliasing.\nWhile very similar to Dynamic Resolution, Upscaling settings render at a fixed resolution and do not dynamically adjust based on performance. For that reason, when Upscaling is enabled, Dynamic Resolution will be automatically disabled.\nWe welcome any and all feedback on these new experimental options! We are especially interested in the visual quality of the game while it is enabled (e.g. any noticeable “smearing” while playing and other weird visual issues). We are also interested in knowing if the settings are clear in communicating what they do.\n\nEnabling \"Shader Cache\" should improve the performance of the game if you are using the DirectX 12 renderer. By storing shaders that have been prepared by the game for future use, loading times and micro-stuttering behaviors seen during gameplay should be reduced, especially on older CPUs.\nApplies to both the \"Classic\" and \"Enhanced\" mode in DX12. DX11 is not affected.\nThere is a small increase to the amount of storage space used by the game.\nThis feature is new and experimental, so let us know if you see anything very strange happen to the game's visuals with \"Shader Cache\" enabled. Or just let us know if the performance of the game is noticeably better!\nImproved DirectX 11’s frame-rate when using the Optimized Flip-Model and reduced input latency.\n“Optimized Flip-Model” is now enabled by default.\nThis option was initially introduced as “experimental” (this label has been removed) and has been working well since its been added. It improves DirectX 11 performance for Borderless and Windowed display modes but requires Windows 10. \nMade systemic micro-optimizations to DirectX 12 performance.\nOptimized code related to DirectX 11.\nMade a micro optimization related to DirectX 12 rendering.\nOptimized code related to DirectX 12.\nFixed a couple rare crashes related to DirectX 12.\nMade systemic micro-optimizations when using DirectX 12 on integrated graphics processors. \nMade systemic micro-optimizations to memory usage. \nMade micro-optimizations to rendering for all platforms.\nFixes towards frame pacing issues that could occur after resizing the game’s window while using DirectX 11 and the “Optimized Flip-Model”. \nOptimized base game code. \nOptimized code related to textures.\nOptimized code related to graphics systems. \nMade systemic micro-optimizations to FX code. \nMade systemic micro-optimizations to code related to rendering. \nMade some micro-optimizations to animation memory. \nOptimized animation code. \nOptimized Umbra during cutscenes in The Sacrifice Quest. \nMade a micro-optimization when loading into large levels that have foliage in them. \nMade micro-optimizations to the game on start-up.\nOptimized the VFX on the following weapons by reducing the particle count on the projectiles when using significant multishot. \nParacyst\nCernos Prime \nDrakgoon\nKuva Bramma\nKuva Chakkurr \nMutalist Cernos\nMiter\nNagantaka Prime\nOptimized the water droplets in Teshin’s Cave. \nFixed significant performance issues when attempting to collect ammo while having a Companion Specter and a regular Warframe Specter active at the same time.\nFixed Rune Marrow not being affected by Resource Boosters.\nFixed Clients losing objective UI and being stuck in the previous Undercroft stage after Host migration. \nFixed tapping Aim while in the middle of a melee swing causing your weapon to get stuck in “Aim mode” until you tap it again.\nFixed another case of Clients losing their Kaithes in The Steel Path Orowyrm fight after a Host migration. \nFixed being able to dismount from Kaithe and consequently losing the ability to respawn it during the Wyrmling ring chase phase in The Steel Path Orowyrm fight. \nKaithe dismounting during this phase is now disabled to prevent further issues. \nFixed being unable to swap to Secondary weapon after not mounting Kaithe when they spawn in The Steel Path Orowyrm fight. \nFixed Sevagoth’s Shadow not benefiting from Decrees. \nFixed Client getting stuck as Drifter for the remainder of an Undercroft mission if they lose connection and attempt to rejoin. \nFixed Focus abilities not working in the Undercroft until after using Transference or being revived (notably Vazarin’s Mending Soul and Enduring Tides). \nFixed Vazarin’s Guardian Shell persisting after leaving Undercroft. \nFixed Clients losing their Vitoplast orb container and eventually losing the ability to shoot/jump/revive/etc. after Host migration in Circuit Void Flood missions. \nFixed the Vitoplast orb container not disappearing for Clients after exiting Void Flood Undercroft missions in Duviri. \nFixed Maw Feeding while the “Herd the Tamms” objective is active causing the Tamms to disappear and making it impossible to complete. \nFixed simultaneous Tamm herding objectives causing players to lose function.\nTo prevent this issue from recurring, there can now only be one instance of Tamm herding occuring at a time. \nFixed recently herded Tamms disappearing upon completing the objective in Duviri. \nFixed being unable to reload guns after melee attacking while using a controller. \nFixed players losing objective UI in Duviri after triggering another nearby side objective. \nFixed Clients losing objective text and enemy spawns halting after Host migration in Circuit Defense missions. \nFixed getting stuck in the Steel Path Circuit reward screen when attempting to join a player who invited them to a Steel Path Circuit mission (due to not having the Steel Path unlocked).   \nFixed accepting an invitation to the Steel Path Circuit opening the Normal reward path screen instead of The Steel Path one.\nFixed the Steel Path Circuit reward path screen appearing before the pop-up informing that you are not eligible after accepting an invite to a Steel Path Circuit mission while not having the Steel Path unlocked. \nFixed new Host not being teleported to next stage in Circuit after Host migration. \nFixed Clients getting stuck in the Undercroft after Host triggers migration by immediately completing the mission. \nFixed rare case where players could get booted back to the Undercroft lobby after dying. \nFixed Undercroft missions as a main Spiral stage automatically completing after Host migration occurs while a Client is waiting in the lobby while others are still in the landscape.\nFixed rare issue where Clients could lose their HUD after entering Duviri from Teshin’s Cave. \nFixed Drifter Melee weapon selection in Teshin’s Cave not saving for Clients after Host migration. \nFixed Host having a randomized loadout upon rejoining the previously left Orowyrm fight. \nFixed the Orowyrm’s Health UI for its rings not updating as it is being damaged for Clients. \nFixed several issues with the offering rotation timing in Acrithis’ Shop: \nFixed the Rare Decree offering not be available for purchase most of the time. It will now appear more regularly. \nFixed Origin System Resources and Ship Decorations (with the exception of the Watchful Paragrimm) appearing for shorter durations than intended. \nFixed the aforementioned items showing less than 5 items at all times. It is intended for each category to have 5 rotation options available at all times. \nFixed being unable to cleanse Conservation animals in Duviri if “Melee with Fire Input” is enabled. \nFixed swapping between Companion types (ie. Sentinel to Kubrow) and attempting to purchase an Appearance Config Slot for their Companion resulting in the player being charged the Platinum cost but not  receiving the Slot. \nThe team is reviewing a script or support path for those affected by this issue!\nFixed enemies not spawning after Host migration occurs while Clients are in the Undercroft lobby. \nFixed loss of function after Host migration in Duviri. \nFixed Clients being unable to grapple to Orowyrm with Orvius more than once in a row due to randomly switching to Drifter Melee in the process. \nFixed being unable to throw the Orvius on foot if another player grabs it at the same moment you are performing a quick shot with the Sirocco.\nFixed Client being revived automatically if downed while Host is dead in Duviri.  \nFixed Clients getting stuck in the Duviri loading screen after Host forces extraction while they are riding Kaithe in an open landscape. \nFixed the Cinta having an unintended alt-fire attack. \nThe “alt-fire” in question (deploy mines and launch the player backwards) was only ever intended and designed for the Dax Arcus enemy. In classic mainline fashion, it slipped by onto the player-owned version accidentally and for that reason had numerous issues (animation weirdness and low damage). \nFixed Clients being stuck in the previous Undercroft stage and UI after Host migration. \nFixed Clients respawning with a weapon other than the intended Sirocco after being downed on Kaithe in the second phase of the Steel Path Orowyrm fight.\nFixed dying immediately after joining an in-progress Orowyrm fight and opening the chest.  \nFixed cases where the camera would aggressively shake while latched to the Orowyrm in the first stage of the fight (especially after opening the pause menu). \nFixed being able to use Transference (to Origin System Drifter/Operator) during the Kaithe phase of The Steel Path Orowyrm fight after Host migration. \nAlso fixed being able to use Last Gasp during this stage if downed. \nFixed Orowrym fight coming to a halt after killing Wyrmlings right as they spawn. \nFixed Host migration towards the end of the Kaithe phase in the Steel Path Orowyrm fight causing the Wyrmlings to respawn. \nFixed the fish not glowing while Maw Feeding if playing in a Squad. \nFixed players' minimap icon being displayed off the map while Maw Feeding, making it difficult to teleport to them. \nFixed players in the Duviri landscape seeing other players' names while they are still in Teshin’s Cave. \nFixed Nidus missing his Mutation Stack UI after replacing his Virulence at Helminth.  \nFixed FOV randomly changing to the minimum while flying on Kaithe in Duviri. \nFixed custom “Ability Menu” button bindings on controller reverting to default after relaunching the game. \nFixed Decree Fragments in The Circuit respawning (after they had all been collected) after Host Migration. \nFixed projectiles shot from Dax enemies in Duviri applying Status Effects to the player even if they had successfully parried it. \nFixed Hildryn’s Aegis Storm CC bypassing the Dax Malleus’ Overguard. \nFixed Clients playing Grendel being able to bypass the Dax Malleus’ Overguard using Feast. \nFixed being unable to bind the controls for the “Spectate Next/Previous Player” option.\nFixed controller sensitive sometimes going very high out of nowhere. \nFixed rare case where rewards and resources would not save to player account after completing a Kuva Lich/Sister of Parvos mission while a hotfix is being launched.\nFixed case where a round reward would get skipped after the first round completed in Interception missions. \nFixed the Drifter becoming unarmed when switching Appearance Configs at the mirror in Teshin's Cave. \nFixed Kaithe not automatically gliding by default (when no directional input is active) like it does in Duviri when spawned into other Open Landscapes. \nFixed enemies in The Circuit dropping Resources, Heavy Ammo, Credits and Mods if a Warframe with a looting ability is present. \nFixed soft-lock occuring after unlocking a Drifter Rank and selecting another category. \nFixed soft-lock occurring when opening Darvo’s shop in the Relays. \nFixed Railjack Crew Members not respawning between missions. \nFixed Clients getting stuck in loading screen after Host abandons Railjack mission. \nFixed Cephalon Cy’s progress bar darkening during the “Maintain the Reactor Within Cy’s Thresholds” stage of Railjack Volatile missions. \nFixed being able to join expired Arbitration missions. \nFixed Excalibur Umbra’s (independent AI version) weapon ammo getting instantly refilled to full from a singular ammo enemy drop. \nFixed Warframe suddenly moving in slow motion when using Drifter Melee weapons. \nFixes towards Visage Ink settings not saving across Clothing configs. \nFixed another case of being unable to make purchases from Acrithis’ wares in Duviri using resources gained from the active session.\nFixed the Shawzin UI in The Duviri Experience displaying the icons of the last Status Effect inflicted onto Drifter instead of the correct button callout.\nFixed being able to send gifts to new players who are playing The Duviri Paradox Quest.\nThe goal is to maintain quest immersion as best as possible and avoid overwhelming new players with too much unrelated activity. Additionally, we want to avoid players receiving items they are unable to interact with until after they complete the quest and move into the Origin System. \nFixed being able accept invites to join

The following changes are intended to make his kit far more comprehensible and dynamic. We revisited the nuances of his abilities and their synergies, simplified them, and made them more situationally viable across the board. Overall, Grendel’s rework has given him more ways to feast on, fight, and flatten anyone that stands in his way!\nIncreased Armor gained from each enemy alive in Grendel’s Gut from 50 to 250.\nAdded a new HUD indicator to show the number of enemies and their Health in Grendel’s Gut. The Armor that he gains from enemies thanks to his passive is now also visible here.  \nRemoved the 1.5/s Energy drain while enemies are in Grendel’s Gut. \nReplaced the Armor Reduction with 2% of their total Shields and Health overtime (does not scale). \nHealth and Shields are more universally applicable, making Nourish affect enemies across a wider range of types.\nUnified Radius for all ranks (25m for all). \nEnemy auras are now disabled while inside Grendel’s Gut. \nFor example, after clearing an Ancient Healer Eximus’ Overguard, casting Feast on it will nullify its damage reduction buff while inside Grendel’s Gut.  \nGrendel can now cast Feast on enemies that are open to a Mercy kill.\nSentient enemies caught in Grendel’s Gut with Feast are no longer automatically expelled after 8 seconds. \nGrendel can now Feast a maximum of 5 enemies at a time. \nWith the above buffs to Feast, the previous 40 enemy max would understandably be far too overpowered. The new cap allows players to make the most of Feast’s more powerful state and keep them actively seeking enemies to chomp on without clearing the whole map in one go.\n\nMoved to the 3rd ability slot. \nWe felt Pulverize didn’t suit the “ultimate” status we’ve prescribed for other Warframes. So instead, we buffed Regurgitate to bring it up to the level we expect for a 4th ability slot. \nGrendel no longer needs to have enemies in his Gut to cast Pulverize. \nWorth noting that even if there are enemies in his Gut, there is no longer an energy-per-second drain tied to them as per the changes made to Feast. \nReduced the drain on an empty Gut from 10 Energy/s to 3 Energy/s. \nFeast, Nourish, and Regurgitate can now be cast while in Pulverize. \nAdded a 50% Armor Reduction (at max rank) to enemies struck by Pulverize (scales with Ability Strength Mods). \nRemoved the Enemy Level multiplier from the total Impact Damage scaling. \nNew formula:  Total Impact Damage = [Impact Base Damage + (Number of Enemies Stored≤10 × 350)] × (1 + Ability Strength)\nGrendel will now heal 200 Health/s for 5 seconds after Pulverize is cast, and then decay to half its starting value over the next 5 seconds (scales with Ability Strength Mods). \nPulverize can now strike tileset breakables (crates, resource deposits, etc.). \nMade several movement improvements: \nImproved general control over Pulverize’s movement. \nImproved movement went traversing slopes to make it smoother. \nMomentum is now maintained on cast in and out. \nStairs can now be climbed while in Pulverize. \nSprint can now be used to go faster but at the cost of control over movement. \nGrendel’s Pulverize form now takes on player customized colors and Voidshell Material Structure customizations if you own the Grendel Voidshell Skin.\nMoved to the 4th ability slot.\nAdded guaranteed Toxin Status Effect. \nAdded 75% Armor Reduction on Regurgitated enemies (scalable with Ability Strength Mods). \nIncreased Toxin Radius Range from 5m to 6m (at max rank). \nAdded VFX on cast to show the affected radius.\nEnemies hit by Regurgitated foes are now slowed by 80%, which decays to 0% over time (6 seconds). \nChanged the total Toxin Damage multiplier from enemy level to total enemy Health %. \nAdded a 50 Energy cost on cast. \nAdded a “Gut Empty” error when attempting to cast Regurgitate without any enemies in Grendel’s Gut.\nRide the wave, Tenno! Yareli has leveled up her water bending skills and increased her survivability with the following changes.\nAdded a 1 second delay before the Critical Flow buff ends after Yareli stops moving.\nEnemies captured in Sea Snares now have 200% Damage Vulnerability from all other sources (similar to Nezha’s Blazing Chakram). \nEnemies that are immune to Crowd Control (Eximus with remaining Overguard for example) will not be impacted by Sea Snares’ immobilizing effect (as intended), but will still be affected with Damage Vulnerability if caught by the ability. Sea Snares’ bubble effects will still circulate around  Crowd-Control-immune enemies to indicate that they are being affected by its Damage Vulnerability (and its other damaging effects).  \nIncreased the seek radius range of Yareli’s Sea Snares from 4m to 10m.\nFor the first 4 seconds after casting, Merulina will gain Health instead of losing it when being attacked, similarly to how Iron Skin functions. Additionally, Yareli will be temporarily invulnerable during the damage absorption. \nMerulina will persist with your Warframe when transferring to and from Operator. \nAlso enabled this for all other K-Drives and Warframes during Transference.\nRiptide can now be cast in different ways for different effects:\nTap to create a Riptide water tornado that pulls in nearby enemies. \nUpon expiry of the ability, or when recasting while Riptide is still active,  the existing Riptide will explode. \nPress and hold to create a Riptide that automatically pulls enemies in and explodes them out (how it used to work before above changes). \n2 seconds after casting, Riptide’s suction range now defaults to 5m (non-scaling). \nSimilar to how Nezha’s Divine Spears impales and slams enemies in two separate actions, Riptide now pulls in enemies first and explodes in the next.\nReduced fire rate from 6 to 5. \nIncreased Semi-Automatic mode’s Critical Chance from 30% to 42%. \nIncreased damage from 46 to 48 for all modes.\nReduced fire rate from 6 to 5. \nIncreased damage from 87 to 97. \nIncreased radial damage from 33 to 53.\nReduced fire rate from 5.42 to 5. \nIncreased damage from 60 to 62.\nReduced fire rate from 7.83 to 5. \nIncreased damage from 36 to 46.\nReduced fire rate from 8.3 to 5. \nIncreased damage from 30 to 36.\nNo changes to fire rate.\nIncreased damage from 36 to 38.\nReduced fire rate from 10 to 4.5. \nIncreased damage from 40 to 64.\nReduced fire rate from 10 to 5. \nIncreased damage from 47 to 70. \nReduced reload time from 2.6 to 2.\nReduced fire rate from 7 to 5. \nIncreased damage from 32 to 44.\nReduced fire rate from 5 to 2.5. \nIncreased damage from 66 to 110.\nReduced fire rate from 8.67 to 3.3.\nIncreased damage from 58 to 98. \nReduced reload time from 2 to 1.6.\nReduced fire rate from 6.33 to 3.3. \nIncreased damage from 66 to 110.\nReduced fire rate from 8.33 to 5. \nIncreased damage from 40 to 42.\nReduced reload time from 2.6 to 2.\nReduced fire rate from 6.67 to 4.5. \nIncreased damage from 30 to 40.\nReduced fire rate from 6.67 to 5. \nIncreased damage from 48 to 60.\nReduced fire rate from 7.5 to 5. \nIncreased damage from 30 to 40.\nReduced fire rate from 6.67 to 3.33. \nIncreased damage from 40 to 64.\nReduced fire rate from 6.67 to 5. \nIncreased damage from 35 to 43 (this also affects the innate Toxin status).\nReduced fire rate from 5.83 to 4.3. \nIncreased damage from 76 to 98. \nIncreased reload time from 1.4 to 1.8.\nReduced fire rate from 6.17 to 5. \nIncreased damage from 76 to 98. \nIncreased reload time from 2.4 to 3.2.\nReduced fire rate from 5.83 to 5. \nIncreased damage from 76 to 98. \nIncreased reload time from 1.2 to 1.6.\nReduced fire rate from 5.83 to 5. \nIncreased damage from 13x10 to 15x10.\nThe following Eximus changes are a follow up to their rework, Eximus Reborn, that launched in Update 31.5: Angels of the Zariman. In that update, Eximus saw an improvement to their mechanic readability and were given consistent Heath/Energy Orbs drops and guaranteed ammo drops. Ultimately these changes made them a clear priority objective and turned them from a threat into an opportunity for players seeking those useful drops. Since then, we have identified where Eximus units are requiring some more tweaks in light of the previous rework: Spawn Logic and Base Health.\nUnified the overall Eximus spawn experience across missions by changing their minimum spawn time down to 60 seconds, and unified the ramp up of spawn rates across all game modes. \nIncreased Eximus spawn chance by 20% across all game modes. \nThe overall increase of spawn chance was made in an effort to make encounters with Eximus more consistent and reliable. This is quite a large encompassing change, so we look forward to your constructive feedback!\nIncreased a portion of their base Health so that they have a bigger Health pool (Overguard remains unchanged, Health only). \nIt is difficult to provide an exact global percent increase since different units scale in different ways, but you should expect to see them have around 30% more total Health. \nIncreased Health threshold for Mercy kills on Eximus.\nBefore they needed to be below 40% Health to be Mercy killed, now that is doubled, so under 80% Health is enough to Mercy kill them.\nCross-Platform Profiles are now viewable! \nDue to technical limitations, stats on profiles are not available. We may be able to make this possible in the future. \nAdded a new message when failing to enter a Dojo on another platform; “Unable to join Cross Platform Dojo. Dojo joining is currently restricted to the same platform only.” \nNo Dojo support is intended as listed in our Cross-Platform Play post. \nAdded an error message when attempting to load into a Cross-Platform Dojo while being in a Cross-Platform squad; “Unable to load into a Cross Platform Dojo while being in a Cross Platform squad. Load into a Dojo first and then invite other platforms to join.”\nThe \"in mission\" status in the \"Recent Players\" list is now enabled for Cross Platform players.\nAdded the functionality to select between users of the same name but different platforms when joining friends in cross platform play. \nFixed being unable to whisper players from a different platform due to them having spaces in their alias. \nIn order to whisper a console player with spaces in their name, you must now add quotation marks around their alias. For example: /w “Kahl Sneak Good 555”. \nFixed @ tags in chat not sending notification to the player being tagged. \nFixed the cross platform icon sometimes not appearing when Cross-Platform Play is enabled. \nFixed players losing their Relay blessing when returning to their Orbiter. \nFixed Cross Platform players being unable to see each other in Relays. \nFixed being unable to view the Host’s Orbiter decorations when invited as Client. \nFixed the # suffix appearing in the UI of the player that scores a goal in Lunaro.\n\n\n\nUpon login, a waypoint will direct you to its new location between the Mods and Incubator Segments. You may need to do some redecorating as your existing decorations may be obstructing your view of it. For new players, this segment becomes available after getting their first Arcane, a waypoint will flash to direct them to the Segment once they do. The former Arcane button in the Foundry will now direct players to the new Segment.\nPlayers will still be able to access and upgrade their Arcanes in their Arsenal, but this Segment will allow for an extensive look at what Arcanes they have across all equipment types!\nIncreased Health gained from Orbs from 25 to 50. \nThis applies to the two guaranteed Health Orbs that are dropped from Eximus Units. \nThe empowered Health Orbs generated by Protea’s Dispensary remain the same (100 Health per Orb). \nLavos’ Transmutation Probe’s Universal Orbs remain the same (25 Health per Orb). \nThe Helminth Archon Shard management screen now shows the ability stats of the equipped Warframe in Helminth’s seat. Hover over the ability icon to get a better idea of how you want to use your Archon Shards. Selecting an Archon Shard upgrade will reflect in the on-hover stats. \nEarning a Riven via Riven Transmutation will no longer take an inventory slot in your overall Riven count. \nVeiled Rivens from Transmutations only take a slot in your inventory once equipped on a weapon, following the Riven Capacity changes from Update 32: Veilbreaker. \nChanged the Void Relic buff message duration from 4 to 7 seconds. Valuable buff information shouldn’t be missed!\nAdded the ability to select a custom binding for “Advanced Mode” decorating in the Controls > Placement menu.\nNew Captura Scenes are available for Stock in Chipper’s Offerings: \nVeilbreak Forest Scene\nVeilbreak Murex Scene\nVeilbreak Factory Scene \nChanged the “Defeat Ven’kra Tel/Sprag” Challenges to be part of the randomized Break Narmer challenge pool instead of expected for their respective missions.  \nPrior to this change, they were 100% guaranteed to show up as challenges for their respective missions. After December 5th, they will no longer be forced and will just be added to the random pool of challenges that rotate. \nRe-enabled Arsenal access in Kahl’s Captura. \nThis was disabled in Hotfix 32.1.1 due to issues with Kahl’s Arsenal. As promised, it has been re-enabled so that you can access your Kahl fashion in Captura. \nFixed Kahl’s Kuva Ayanga displaying ammo numbers despite having infinite ammo. \nFixed seeing your Warframe wearing Kahl attachments instead of Kahl himself when entering the Drifter Camp scene in Kahl’s Captura. \nFixed the mission overview for Break Narmer missions always showing “mission failed” and 0s on mission time even if it was a success.  \nFixed Kahl gliding in the air towards targeted enemy if “Melee Auto Targeting” option is toggled on. \nFixed the Break Narmer mission start button appearing as \"MENU_GENERIC1 START MISSION\" while using a controller. \nFixed being unable to close out of the End of Mission screen after aborting a Break Narmer mission while using a controller. \nFixed Kahl’s Grakata sticking straight up after throwing Incendiary Grenades while scooting around on jetpack. \nFixed being unable to damage the Narmer Scyto Raknoid while Kahl has the Machete equipped. \nFixed crash related to using the Veilbreaker ability and mashing the context action while flying around with Hellion Jetpack. \nFixed the Gene Stamp context action being low res.\nFixed crash that would occur when attempting to enter the Dormizone and Drifter Camp Captura scene with Kahl.\nFixed a duplicate Kuva Ayanga appearing on the ground after mounting a Rampart in the Junk Run mission. \nFixed the tree behind Kahl’s Garrison having a semi-transparent root.\nAllies in range of Well of Life’s radius are now protected from Status Effects. When a Status Effect is blocked, the enemy trapped in Well of Life takes a 10% hit to their Health. \nA projectile FX now circles the enemy affected by Well of Life to indicate when an ally is protected from Status Effects. \nIncreased Trinity’s Well of Life base range from 8 meters to 15 meters.\nRemoved the Wolf Sledge, Telos Boltace, Zenith, Tatsu, Tatsu Prime, and Staticor from Conclave. \nIn their current state, they had several broken interactions. \nDisabled melee auto-blocking in Conclave.\nDisabled shield gating in Conclave.\nDisabled Atlas’ Rumblers having Petrify AOE in Conclave.\nFixed the Lacera dealing Toxin Damage instead of Electricity Damage on ground slams in Conclave. \nFixed Electricity Status Effects reproc-ing themselves repeatedly, especially if proc duration was longer (notably with Saryn's passive). \nFixed Gas Status Effects using its non-Conclave duration.\nAmmo pickups have a brand new look!  \nNot pictured: Heavy Ammo pickups, but they have been updated as well! \nUpdated the in-game Market landing page to showcase Update specific (Lua’s Prey) and Featured categories instead of a single grid. \nThis is a soft launch to test various features for the landing page, and as such will only appear from some players and not all. \nThe Somachord’s UI in the Personal Quarters has a new look for all your music listening needs!\nAlso added helpful tips about the Somachord and Tones.\nIncreased the roll distance of Mirage’s Passive.\nBefore this change, Mirage's increased roll speed affected how fast the roll animation played, but moved her forward at the same rate, resulting in the roll traveling less distance. Now, the roll moves forward faster, to match the increased animation, so that she travels a distance comparable to a normal roll.\nThe Exodia Force Arcane will no longer trigger Saryn’s Toxic Lash.\nThis combo was causing significant performance issues.\nUpdated the Zariman tileset’s PBR to add more roughness and color variation. \nRemoved the colorful flash of light when Thrax enemies leap in Zariman missions. \nAdded icons and name of the drop sources of Pigment Sources in the Dye Research screen. \nAdded a chime sound FX to the Ostron Wind Chime Dojo Decoration! \nAdded a pulsing glow FX to Xaku’s unused The Lost abilities while The Relentless Lost Augment Mod is equipped. \nWhen receiving an invitation from another player to their Orbiter the options are now Accept/Decline. \nThe options were previously Yes/No. \nCleaned up some FX related to the Exodia Force Arcane.\nThe Last Gasp Indicator now pulses to its FX audio. \nReduced the cooldown on the Drifter’s Restorative ability in The New War Quest from 13 to 15 seconds.\nRemoved all of the extra decimal 0s from stats display to reduce the visual noise it was creating. \nReduced the flare size of the Kuva Tonkor’s explosion. \nRemoved the Archwing Corpus Attack Drone from the Simulacrum. \nAdjusted the drop shadow text in the in-game Markets to improve readability. \nUpdated the in-game Market search bar to the new theme variant. \nIncreased the beam on pickups to improve visibility. \nThe Male Helmet Pack and Pistoleer Special bundles have been retired from the in-game Market, as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1331241-upcoming-market-bundle-retirements/?ct=1669655623\nImproved the clarity of the Demolisher’s beep sound FX.\nMade performance improvements to the Sporelacer’s alt-fire projectiles. \nAlso added FX to indicate the multishot of its alt-fire projectiles. \nMade Physics engine performance and memory optimizations. \nMade fixes towards Gauss’ Mach Crash Augment with Xata’s Whisper crushing FPS.  As reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1324649-gamebreaking-ragdoll-xatas-bug-affecting-clients-with-ping-and-host-with-unplayable-fps/\nMade systemic micro-optimizations to the script runtime. \nFixed the Kompressa’s explosions causing significant spikes in GPU/CPU times.\nImproved login and Lunaro load-times for people in Clans or Alliances without Emblems. \nImproved compression quality in the Leverian which improves the appearance of the floor. Drusus doesn’t have all that mopping done for nothing.\nMade micro-optimization to memory.\nImproved lighting performances on older computers. \nMade several optimizations to cloth performance. \nCuts cloth loading time in half on PC.\nOptimized PhysX performance.\nTweaked reporting of crashes due to being out of memory.\n",

The Void exposes old scars and revives forgotten secrets. Smelling possible treasure, the Grineer have descended upon these newly exposed halls, only to be instantly Corrupted by its long-dormant Orokin Neural Sentry.\nThe fundamentals of a Conjunction Survival mission are the same as other Survival missions: maintain Life Support by triggering Life Support Towers and procuring Life Support Capsules dropped by slain enemies. However, additional gameplay mechanics add a new layer of difficulty and variety, fit only for the ancient halls of Lua stirred by the Void.\nUpon triggering the alarms, a Lone Guardian begins to make their way to the Life Support Towers throughout Lua. They are at the center of an area null of all colors that follows their every move. Entering the area grants players 100% Ability Strength and a 50% Casting Speed buff for 5 seconds (as long as you remain in the bubble, the duration refreshes).\nA new tile within both Yuvarium and Circulus can be found for Tenno that seek it out. Those who have heard the tale of Voruna from her Leverian may feel a familiar presence here.\nVisit the official public drop tables for more information.\nThis is where your Necramech comes in handy!

This third and final batch of buffs tackles Warframe Augments from Saryn to Zephyr. We have increased their viability in missions, which we hope will encourage more build diversity.\n*Stats below are all at Max Rank.\nWas: Infected enemies within 40m will show up on the Minimap. \nChanges: \nThe 40m radius now properly (scales with Ability Range).  \nAdded +40 Enemy Radar (scales only with rank of mod).\nWas: Hitting at least 4 enemies with Spellbind will grant Titania 50 Energy. \nChanges: \nSuccessfully hitting at least 4 enemies also adds 40% more range on the next cast of Spellbind.\nWas: Attracted enemies take 100% more melee damage. \nChanges: \nThe 100% damage bonus now applies to all weapons (including Titania’s Dex Pixia and Diwata) and scales with Ability Strength.\nWas: On death, marked enemies will drop 4 Health Orbs with a 25% chance of dropping an Energy Orb. \nChanges:\nEnergy Orbs now have a 100% chance of dropping.

Because of the Helminth system, this Augment was being used more than Nova herself. Changing the Augment to Heat damage while also releasing Archon Vitality resulted in higher damage than anticipated (multiplied by squadmates’ damage boosts), and the auto-seeking nature made Neutron Star far better at room clearing than other Helminth radial damage abilities like Thermal Sunder. We have a history of encouraging engagement with the enemy instead of automation, so LOS changes seemed the most important factor to address, while still letting it maintain the new high damage features.\nReduced the Mastery Rank restriction of all Prime Warframes to 0. \nOnly 11/34 frames had any Mastery Rank restrictions, so we decided to make these consistent with the rest (there were no Mastery Rank restrictions on any non-Primed Warframes).\nThe autocomplete feature when linking someone’s username in chat is no longer case sensitive. \nMade slight tweaks to the Conservation Lure call and Vasca Kavat escape sound FX.\n\n",

  "changes": "Included Labels for the necessary Syndicate rank needed for the Wares in Chipper’s Inventory and a banner to visually display which Rank you’re currently at. This aims to clarify which Rank you’re at and which ones come next.\nImproved camera placement for Chipper to avoid any awkward angles, even though he looks good from every angle. \nFixed many cases of Chipper not appearing in the Drifter Camp after saving him on Venus. \nEnsured friendly Grineer are always in the Drifters Camp regardless of which Break Narmer mission is active\nRemoved the ability for Styanax to recast Final Stand multiple times while in the air. \nThe facts: with the synergy of Rally Point providing Energy and Shields, you can spend almost your entire mission in the air. For transparency, this is something we caught earlier in development, but this change was missed for the release of Veilbreaker. You can still be in the air when you first cast Final Stand, but to recast, your toes must first touch a surface, similar to how Transference casting is done.\nhttps://gfycat.com/goodnaturedkaleidoscopicanhinga \nFixed multiple players playing as Styanax causing the most recent Rally Point cast to remain active even if it's the weaker of all the casts. \nIf Rally Point is already active, it will not be replaced by another player’s cast IF it’s stronger (based on Ability Strength/magnitude of effects) than what they are trying to apply. In other words, if somebody has 200% Ability Strength and casts Rally Point on themselves, and then another player casts it at 50% Ability Strength, it will now skip over anybody who already had the 200% version. \nYour active Rally Point can still be overridden by a weaker cast IF there is fewer than 10 seconds left on your active buff.\nFixed Axios Javelin not triggering a vortex when successfully pinning enemies to the wall or floor as Client.\nSentient resource drop chances reduced from 50% to 7% in Archon Hunts specifically.\nFor some brief history on this change: Sentients used to only be found as rare enemies on Lua, so the high drop rate chance for regional resources was justified. On their inclusion in Orphix Venom in 2020, we used a custom override to their drop tables to reduce their high resource drop chance to something more sustainable. On their recent inclusion to Archon Hunts, the drop table custom override was mistakenly not added. This led to players earning over 6x the amount of resources typically collected in a brief window of time, which led to false positive trade bans. \nWe will potentially revisit these droptables in the future to prevent needing to use a custom drop chance for these Sentients to avoid this accidentally happening again.\nNote: this change does not affect the Drop chance probability for Mods or Weapon Components\nReduced the amount of Vortex VFX from stacking when casting Vauban’s Bastille into the same spot. \nUpdated the launcher tab icons for improved readability. \nChanged ‘Visit Varzia’ prompt button to the back right controller trigger when using a controller on PC.\nFixed using Archon Stretch with Volt’s Discharge causing FPS to plummet for Host.\n",
  "fixes": "Break Narmer Mission Changes & Fixes:\nAdded Ability for Kahl to use Finishers on Narmer Moa’s when they are stunned by Kahl’s Veilbreaking ability. \nAdded Sound FX to Kahl grabbing ledges, and a grunt to his mantle animation. \nAdded Sound FX when Kahl transports his Brothers to the Railjack. \nFixed being able to walk along a slanted window in certain areas of the Veil Factory, which would cause you to clip through the factory tileset. \nFixed the Narmer Scyto Raknoid standing completely still if Kahl runs past it to the ship located outside the stage. \nFixed Narmer Moas in the ‘Sneaky Sabotage’ mission dropping ammo, Energy Orbs, and Credits.

Our goals were to make all abilities relevant, while simplifying some mechanics for new players to better understand. The changes are as follows:\nReworked chain targeting to pick the next best target after each slash instead of at the start. \nInvalid targets aren’t removed from the list of potential targets as they may become valid again at some point (re-entering Line Of Sight or being at a closer distance).\nDamage is now 100% Slash, guaranteeing Slash Status Effect.  \nIncreased overall speed when dashing between enemies. \nIncreased active targeting of extra units. \nCan now be canceled by jumping or dodging.\nReduced the slashing animation.\nImproved in-air slash dashing animations. \nUpdated the FX with an accompanying Excalibur phantom trail after performing a Slash Dash.\nRemoved the cap on enemies that can be hit by Radial Javelin. \nPrior to the change, there was a limit to the number of enemies Radial Javelin could hit. So, for example (not accurate numbers), even if 15 enemies were in range, it would only hit 10. Now it hits absolutely everything in range!  \nAdded guaranteed Slash Status Effect. \nAnimation tweaks:\nIncreased the size of the javelins. \nThe Javelins will now visually aim for the chest.\nNo longer requires you to Bullet Jump to pull pickups towards her.\nNow creates a mini-vortex when casting, which gathers enemies in front of Mag. Polarize Shards on the ground will also be Pulled into this Vortex.\nHelminth: Changed Mag’s Pull to now have diminished range when infused. Was 25m at max, now 12.5m.\nShards from Polarize are pulled into the Magnetize Bubble, including Shards orbiting Mag. \nCharged Magnetize absorb shards increase its damage by 500 for each one. Scales with Ability Strength mods. \nIncreased the angle of Protective cast from 80 to 120 degrees across all ranks. \nUnified Range value across all ranks (15m for Explosion Radius, 4m for Bubble Radius). \nUnified Protective cast Absorption Multiplier across all ranks to 2x.\nAdded an FX when the Shards projectile expires. \nFixed the burst FX being incorrectly rotated.\nShards are now significantly larger and hover above the ground, making them much easier to see.\nShards within 3m of Mag now orbit her, inflicting the Slash or Puncture Status Effect to nearby enemies.\nUnified Range and Duration across all ranks to 8m and 5s respectively.\nUnified range across all ranks to 18m.\nIncreased the points of Electricity Damage added for every 1 meter traveled from 5 to 10.  \nUpdated passive to also include bonus damage to ‘Shock’ on attacks that bounce.\nReduced cost from 25 to 15 energy. \nUnified range across all ranks to 15m.\nIncreased base speed from 50% to 75%, and unified across all ranks. \nIncreased duration from 5/10s to 9/12s (base/max). \nIncreased the reload speed buff from 17.5% to 25%.\nUnified the range for all ranks to 25m.\nRemoved Speed reduction while carrying the Shield. \nRemoved Energy Drain for every 4 meters traveled while carrying the Shield.. \nRemoved Secondary weapon restriction. Primary and Melee weapons can now be used while carrying Shield. \nUpdated sound FX for picking up and dropping Shield.\nUnified Electric Pulse Range to 20m across all ranks, and Electric Arc Radius to 8m across all ranks.\nOverall damage of Celestial Twin has been halved, but marking enemies with your Ability Button still offers a 3x damage boost against marked targets. \nCelestial Twin is vulnerable to self-stagger from its own weapon. \nAs the Twin shares your Wukong’s loadout, this can be bypassed by adjusting your mods accordingly if you wish.\nWukong and his Celestial Twin now share an Ammo Pool. Ammo that is picked up by either you or your Celestial Twin is shared between you. Upon running out of ammo for a specific weapon, the Twin will either swap to a weapon in your loadout that does have ammo or swap to melee when completely out of ammo. The Twin will also search out Ammo pickups.\nPrior to this change, Celestial Twin had an infinite ammo pool, which allowed for the use of high-impact low-ammo weapons, such as the Bramma, to be used far outside the weapon's balance intentions. Since your Twin now inherents your loadout, a more active role is encouraged to maintain its effectiveness.  \nMade several HUD adjustments to Wukong’s Celestial Twin/Defy icons so that they are not stretched or overlap other UI elements.\nMelee stance has been reworked to modern standards \nbigger hits in the combos now have larger damage multipliers built in. \nAdded a short duration vortex pull at the end of his forward combo when he slams the floor. Does not scale with Ability Strength Mods.\nNow grants 1 second of invulnerability after a charge is consumed.\nThe addition of Overguard affected the efficiency of Mesmer Skin, as rapidfire Overguarded enemies would melt through their Mesmer Skins and remain unaffected by the incoming sleep effect. To bring this ability closer to its original intention, Mesmer Skin will now grant 1 second of invulnerability after a charge is consumed. This gives players time to react to these powerful units before taking their full damage.\nIncreased maximum stored damage from 1.6k to 5k.  \nChanged the casting animation to be only upper body and use one hand. \nThis allows casting to be done without interrupting shooting. \nChanged damage accumulation to be shown as a buff indicator instead of % on ability. \nThe refresh buff indication now calls out ‘Ballistic Battery’ outright and uses its ability icon while accumulating. \nMesa now has the ability to use Ballistic Battery during Peacemaker. \nBuff indicator refreshes when the shot is fully charged.\nIn Update 31.2, we buffed a number of underused Warframe augments. The time has come to continue this work! This batch tackles Warframes from Loki to Rhino (of which there are surprisingly many!). We have increased their viability in missions, which we hope will  encourage more build diversity.\n*Stats below are all at Max Rank.\nWas: After teleporting with an Ally they will be invulnerable for 6s.\nNow: Offers half the invulnerability time for Loki, and cleanses status on both targets when switching. \nAlso added a HUD icon for invulnerability time for Loki when switching to an enemy.\nWas: Survivors have their armor decreased by 50% and become unable to move for 7 seconds.\nNow: Augment functions unchanged, casting speed is increased by 50%.\nWas: Reflected bullets gain a 50% chance of staggering enemies.\nNow: Augment function unchanged, reflected bullet stagger chance now scales with Ability Strength (up to 100% stagger if you have 200%+ Ability Strength).\nWas: Applies a 100% Status Chance bonus to the shot, based on the amount charged.\nNow: The shot gains a +50% Final Critical Chance bonus, based on the amount charged.\nWas: Use on a downed ally to revive them with 30% of health. Nekros’s energy will be consumed. \nNow: Core Augment function unchanged, but no longer requires all of Nekros’ Energy to be consumed on cast. It now costs the same as base Soul Punch (25 Energy) to cast.  \nAlso added 2 seconds of invulnerability for the revived player to protect them during the standing-animation.\nWas: Accumulate 150% of the damage Fire Walker deals, unleashing it in a trail of fire that lasts 10s. \nNow: Accumulate 250% of damage done by Fire Walker, and the trail of fire forces a Heat Status Effect. Duration is unchanged.\nWas: Nidus has a 60.0% chance of generating an additional Mutation stack whenever he gains one, while standing in the Ravenous Infestation.\nNow: The chance to gain extra stacks now scales with Power Strength, and chances higher than 100% have the chance to give multiple Mutation Stacks. \nEx. 150% is guaranteed 1 bonus Mutation and 50% to get a second.\nWas: Reactivate Larva to detonate and deal 300 Toxin Damage in 5m Range. This damage stacks for every enemy grabbed by the Larva. \nNow:  Reactivate Larva to detonate and deal 600 Toxin Damage in 8m Range. This damage stacks for every enemy grabbed by the Larva.\nWas: On recast, all remaining particles will seek out enemies and deal 120 Blast Damage with guaranteed Status Effect in 8 meters.\nNow: On recast, all remaining particles will seek out enemies and deal  240 Heat Damage with a guaranteed Heat Status Effect to foes within 16 meters. Particles from Neutron Star have a doubled “seek radius” to find targets compared to Null Star.\nWas: Absorbs enemy bullets within 3 meters, increasing its damage when it explodes. \nNow: Absorbs enemy bullets within 5 meters, increasing its damage when it explodes.\nWas: Affected enemies will be confused for 10 seconds. \nNow: Core Augment function unchanged. Creates an additional 3 Bolts on cast.\nWas: Allows for two simultaneous Mallets, each with 50% reduced range. \nNow: Core Augment function unchanged. The Range for the simultaneous Mallets is increased to 80%.\nWas: Enemies hit are blinded by Reave’s fog for 10s.\nNow: Core Augment function unchanged. Reave gains +40% Range.\nWas: Iron Skin Health is replenished by 80 for each enemy affected.\nNow: Iron Skin Health is restored by 4% for each enemy affected. The value of health restored no longer scales with Ability Strength.\nThe percentage of Iron Skin Health restored is based on the Peak Value of Iron Skin following ability cast and invulnerability period.\nThis change should help this Augment scale better in higher-level missions instead of using flat Health values.\nWas: Enemies within 25m will be knocked down and suffer from a Puncture Status Effect. Roar can be recast. \nNow: Enemies within 25m will be knocked down and suffer 10 stacks of Puncture Status. Roar can be recast. Additionally increases Roar’s Range by +40%.\nWas: Enemies affected by Reckoning emit a 2m Area of Effect that increases Ally armor by 250 and inflicts 150 damage per second to enemies.\nNow: Area of Effect Range increased to 3m, which scales with Ability Range. Enemy damage increased to 300 damage per second. Additionally increases the Range of Reckoning by 40%.\n\nArmor is a fundamental part of Warframe’s balance, but the act of stripping armor has always been somewhat hard to gauge. Currently, when an armor stripping Ability is cast it uses the target’s current armor as the base for its calculation. This means that you may have to cast that Ability several times on the same enemy in order to strip their armor completely.\nPlayers have adapted to this system by maximizing Ability Strength to the point where the armor stripping effect is as close to 100% as possible \nthus reducing the number of casts required to strip armor to one.\nIn the effort of encouraging build diversity and streamlining the way that armor stripping abilities work, we are making the following changes:\nThis applies to every single Armor removal ability in the game. We have also buffed a few of these abilities in the process to bring them up to a usable level in light of these changes:\nIncreased Frost's Avalanche armor reduction from 40% to 60% and changed the armor reduction to be permanent.\nFrost’s Avalanche can also now reduce armor from targets even if they are immune to crowd control abilities. \nIncrease Nekros' Terrify armor reduction from 20% to 60%.\nIncrease Oberon's Reckoning armor reduction from 30% to 50%.\nChanged Banshee's Sonic Fracture (Augment) armor reduction to be permanent.\nIncrease Mag's Fracturing Crush (Augment) armor reduction from 50% to 75%, remove the 80% cap per cast and change the armor reduction to be permanent.\nIncrease Trinity's Abating Link (Augment) armor reduction from 45% to 60%.\nArea of Effect (AoE) weapons are a pretty dominant aspect of Warframe gameplay, especially affected by the removal of self-damage a few years ago. We want AoE weapons to feel impactful, but we feel their current state needs adjustment.\nBefore we get into the specific ‘WHAT’ of the changes to AoE, let’s talk about the broad ‘WHY’ of these changes. There are 3 core reasons:\n 1) “Can this be automated?” \nCurrently, some explosive weapons and playstyles remove the need to aim, or otherwise care about your surroundings.  This doesn’t fit the “automated” category perfectly, but we want such impactful weapons to require more consideration and tactical decision making than currently exists.\n2) “Is this overly dominant?” \nWarframe is a game full of very powerful tactics, but problems arise when players feel ‘forced’ to use specific choices. The top 5 most popular weapons are all AoE, accounting for 47% of all weapon usage at high Mastery Rank AOE usage stats. In situations where efficiency is important, some would say you aren’t playing ‘correctly’ if you’re not utilizing these choices, which some players don’t necessarily find fun.\n 3) “Is this playstyle disruptive to other players?” \nA majority of sessions are played co-op, so ideally everybody gets a chance to play. We’ve reached a point where players are asking us to change these weapons, because they leave so little for others to do.\nWith our motivations clear, we can now get into specifics. We approached this change in a multitude of ways:\nAmmo Changes\na. Ammo Pick Up \nb. Holster Speed Buffs & Mod Changes \nHeadshot Damage Changes \nPrimed Fulmination and Primed Firestorm Rebalancing\nNew Steel Path Missions: Void Fissures\nWe understand the power fantasy of these weapons is very popular for some, so our first approach was to keep them powerful, but limit how often they can be used by making changes to ammo pick-up.\nPrimary \nfrom 60 to 80\nSecondary \nfrom 20 to 40\nIncreased Alt fire ammo requirement from 10 to 15.\nIncreased Alt fire ammo requirement from 3 to 9.\nFaster regen rate from empty for 2 secs.\nAlt fire is no longer a toggle, and doesn't require  a full mag to fire.\nTotal damage is now based on ammo in mag on fire.\nKuva Bramma \nKuva Ogris\nKuva Zarr\nLenz \nProboscis Cernos\n3 Ammo per Pick Up:\nTonkor\nKuva Tonkor\n4 Ammo per Pick Up:\nTenet Envoy\n5 Ammo per Pick Up:\nCarmine Penta \nPenta\nSecura Penta\nOgris\n9 Ammo per Pick Up:\nZarr\n10 Ammo per Pick Up:\nTorid\n15 Ammo per Pick Up:\nArca Plasmor\nCatchmoon (Primary) \nCedo\nCernos\nCernos Prime\nCorinth\nCorinth Prime\nDaikyu\nDread\nDrakgoon\nExergis\nFelarx\nHek\nKomorex\nKuva Chakkhurr\nKuva Drakgoon\nKuva Hek\nLanka\nMK1-Paris\nMK1-Strun\nMutalist Cernos\nParis\nParis Prime\nPhantasma\nRakta Cernos\nRubico\nRubico Prime\nSancti Tigris\nSimulor\nSporothrix\nSporelacer (Primary) \nSnipetron\nSnipetron Vandal\nSobek\nSynoid Simulor\nStrun\nStrun Prime\nStrun Wraith\nTenet Arca Plasmor\nTigris\nTigris Prime\nVaykor Hek\nVectis\nVectis Prime\nVulkar\nVulkar Wraith\n20 Ammo per Pick Up:\nTombfinger (Primary)\n40 Ammo per Pick Up:\nAcceltra\nAeolak\nAlternox\nAstilla\nAstilla Prime\nBoar\nBoar Prime\nGaze (Primary) \nIgnis\nIgnis Wraith\nKohm\nKuva Kohm\nMiter\nOpticor\nOpticor Vandal\nStahlta\nTenet Tetra\nVermisplicer (Primary)\n60 Ammo per Pick up:\nAmprex\nJavlok\nScourge\nScourge Prime\nTrumna\nZhuge Prime\nBasmu: From 42/s to 10.5/s\nBubonico: From 9/s to 4.5/s\nFlux Rifle: From 40/s to 24/s\nFulmin: From 30/s to 20/s\nShedu: From 28/s to 3.5/s\nAngstrum\nPrisma Angstrum\nKulstar\n4 Ammo per Pick Up:\nCastanas\nSancti Castanas\nPox\nTalons\n5 Ammo per Pick Up:\nAkarius\n9 Ammo per Pick Up:\nKuva Seer\n20 Ammo per Pick Up:\nAkbronco\nAkbronco Prime\nAtomos\nBrakk \nBronco\nBronco Prime\nCatabolyst\nCatchmoon (Secondary) \nCyanex\nDetron \nEpitaph\nEuphona Prime\nGaze (Secondary) \nKohmak\nTwin Kohmak\nKompressa\nKuva Nukor \nKuva Brakk\nMara Detron\nNukor\nPyrana \nPyrana Prime\nSepulcrum\nSporelacer (Secondary) \nSonicor\nStaticor\nTenet Detron\nTombfinger (Secondary) \nTwin Rogga\nVermisplicer (Secondary) \nZakti\nZakti Prime\nZymos\nArca Plasmor: From 48 to 50 \nCorinth: From 132 to 135\nGaze (Primary): From 400 to 200 \nKuva Zarr: From 15 to 5\nKuva Ogris: From 30 to 7\nKuva Tonkor: From 60 to 11 \nMiter: From 72 to 80\nProboscis Cernos: From 9 to 7\nSporelacer (Primary): From 130 to 60 \nTenet Envoy: From 24 to 16 \nTombfinger (Primary): From 540 to 120\nVermisplicer (Primary): From 226 to 90 \nZarr: From 84 to 60 \nSecondary Weapons: \nEpitaph: From 60 to 40 \nGaze (Secondary): From 400 to 200 \nVermisplicer (Secondary): From 226 to 90\nSecondary Weapons with Ammo Regen Rates Overrides:\nCycron: From 40/s to 20/s \nTenet Cycron: From 40/s to 20/s\nUsed to drop from 70% of regular enemies and 80% of Open World enemies, now they drop less frequently, with smaller squads getting more drops\n1p squad = 45%, or 60% in Open Worlds\n2p squad = 37.5%, or 52.5% in Open World\n3p squad = 30%, or 45% in Open Worlds\n4p squad = 22.5%, or 37.5% in Open Worlds\nOn average you’ll be getting Ammo drops half as often, but most weapons with the aforementioned increase of pickup values receive twice as much.\nIncreased the chance of a Riven Sliver dropping from Eximus Units.\nSteel Path Eximus: changed from 1% to 2% drop chance\nRegular Eximus: changed from 0.5% to 2% drop chance\nNote that Riven Slivers still only have a chance to drop from Eximus level 30 and over\nRifle Ammo Mutation: Now converts Secondary ammo pickups to 50% of Ammo Pick Up. \nPistol Ammo Mutation: Now converts Primary ammo pickups to 50% of Ammo Pick Up. \nShotgun Ammo Mutation: Now converts Secondary ammo pickups to 50% of Ammo Pick Up.\nSniper Ammo Mutation: Now converts Secondary ammo pickups to 50% of Ammo Pick Up. \nPrimary/Secondary Merciless Arcane: Removed its +100% Ammo Maximum bonus. \nVigilante Supplies Mod: Now converts Secondary ammo pickups to 30% of ammo pickup. \nMirage’s Explosive Legerdemain Augment: Increased damage dealt from proximity mines created from Ammo and Orbs pickups from 500 to 1000.\nDeployable Ammo Restores now restore 1x (for small), 2x (for medium), and 3x (for large) Primary and Secondary Ammo Pick up amounts every 15s for 60s.\nWe’ll be keeping a close eye on how these ammo changes affect specific weapons’ performance and popularity. Expect more tweaks to these values in future updates!\n\nThese changes to Ammo encourage swapping between weapons, so we’ve taken the opportunity to dramatically increase the swapping speed between Primary and Secondary. The real purpose of your Secondary weapon is for it to be a backup to your Primary, but with the holster speeds the way they were before that vision was not realized \nuntil now!\n\nIn light of the overall speed buff to holster speed, we have made the following changes to the mods and Arcanes that offered holster speed stat increases:\nVigorous Swap:\nRemoved its 100% Holster Speed” bonus on equip \nbut maintained its +165% Damage for 3s.\nStreamlined Form:\nRemoved its +60% Holster Rate bonus. \nIncreased Slide buff from 15% to 30%. \nIncreased Friction Reduction from 15% to 30%. \nThis mod is chronically underused, so it easily deserved to be a bit stronger in light of the holster changes!\nSynth Reflex:\nRemoved its 100% Holster Speed bonus and reload 5% of Magazine/s when holstering Primary and Secondary weapons. \nReplaced with +40% Bullet Jump for 2 secs.\nSpeed Holster Aura Mod:\nRenamed to Holster Amp.\nRemoved its +120% Holster Rate bonus. \nIt now deals +60% Damage for 3s on equip.\nPrimary/Secondary Dexterity Arcane:\nRemoved their “+60% Holster Speed” bonus.\nReflex Draw, Soft Hands, Twitch (Conclave):\nRemoved their holster rate increase. \nThey now apply -40% Weapon Recoil and -40% spread for 8s on equip.\n\nDuring playtesting, the ammo changes alone weren’t enough to significantly change things for AoE weapons. So instead of tightening these values to be overly restrictive, we chose to address other factors that make these weapons so strong, such as headshot damage.\nOur approach here is two-fold, to reduce the impact of headshots for AOE weapons, but to also make precision headshots pack a larger punch overall.\nRadial damage no longer gains extra headshot damage or triggers headshot conditions.\nThis is primarily targeted at the Ignis Wraith \nas a “flamethrower” weapon, it’s hard to imagine a blanket of elements being precise enough to target weak points specifically. Explosive projectiles themselves can still land headshots, so there is still a reason to aim with most weapons for maximum damage.\nIncreased the base damage multiplier on headshots from 2x to 3x. \nThis means precision weapons are more rewarded for skillful usage, leveling the playing field even further!\nFinally, we’ve changed the effects on a few specific mods that increase explosive radius.\nIn light of the above changes, we have also buffed the following mods:\nWhile evaluating AoE, we found another angle of consideration: mission design. Specifically Fissure missions where AoE lethality is common and problematic. For each new Prime Access, we ask players to revisit these lower level missions to open Relics \nin Lith missions it can be difficult to even earn Reactant if you kill too quickly! Which leads us to the following addition of Steel Path Void Fissure Missions.\nIf you are an experienced Warframe player, you are extremely familiar with the Void Fissure mission flow: Select Relic and blitz through enemies to crack it. It is obvious that where Void Fissure missions are, they are far too easy and can be completed with little to no friction (looking at you Lith). Ultimately, this makes the Prime content not as engaging as it could be, while also leaving new players behind in the dust as the experienced rip through enemies before they can get to them.\nWhen enabling Steel Path in Navigation, Void Fissure missions in the World State Window will now have the usual Steel Path flare apply (Acolytes, difficulty modifiers, etc.). To make it worth your while, 1 x Steel Essence is also awarded for every Relic you crack.\nAs you can see, we’ve evaluated the problem from many different angles, and are hopeful that these changes will lead to a healthier gamestate overall. As part of our comprehensive AOE review pass, we focused on weapons with Ammo Pools. We are aware of the way Glaive/Thrown Melees behave and are reviewing closely to see if their dominance will require a revision pass as well. But as always, we’ll be watching for your feedback. So bring your AoE weapons into a mission and get a good feel for it (with all of the above in mind) before you share your thoughts.\nWe have changed the way that Spear Guns function in-game to help increase their viability in mission. Based on overwhelming community feedback we’ve:\nRemoved the need to manually retrieve your Spear Gun once it’s been thrown. Your Spear Gun now re-appears in your hand using reload.\nRemoved the need to charge your Spear Gun to throw it, simply Tap alt-fire to throw!\nWithin the arsenal, ‘Charged Throw’ stats have simply become ‘Throw’ stats.\nSpear Guns have also received new throw animations and updated sound FX on reload, plus a new Spear Gun category has been added when searching for weapons in the Arsenal.\n\nWe have decoupled the need to wear an affiliated Syndicate Sigil to gain Standing in-mission. Meaning Syndicate Sigils are now purely cosmetic!\n*Pledging is only available for the 6 Faction Syndicates: Steel Meridian, New Loka, Arbiters of Hexis, Cephalon Suda, Red Veil, and The Perrin Sequence.\nPledging is done in the Syndicate segment in your Orbiter. You will be able to select which Syndicate to Pledge to after accessing your Syndicate Segment following this update. Should you change your mind, you can simply select the ‘Change Pledge’ button and select a new Syndicate to pledge yourself to. Alternatively, you can Rescind your Pledge if you are unsure what Syndicate to commit to.\nTo help with managing your Standing across Syndicates, pledging allegiance now better displays the Syndicate’s relationship status with the other Syndicates (neutral, enemy, or allied).\n\n\nThose familiar with Rivens may be aware that they come in two states: Veiled and Unveiled. Both of these kinds of Rivens take up Riven Slots and can be equipped to weapons.\nIn this new, these Mods will not show Riven Challenges or take up a Riven Slot until they are equipped onto a weapon. The Mod description for this new Mod type explains this mechanic as well.\nHere is a breakdown of the three Riven states for clarity:\n‘???’ Rivens\nAll new Rivens obtained via Rewards, Palladino, etc.\nStackable and will not take up Riven Slots\nRiven Type (Archgun, Rifle, etc.) is revealed, but not the Challenge\nTradeable\nVeiled\nWhat an Indistinct Riven becomes once equipped to a Weapon\nChallenge Revealed\nTakes up Riven Slots\nTradeable\nUnveiled\nChallenge Completed\nStats are revealed and can be cycled via Kuva\nTradeable\nSince the only number we have to track with this new Riven state is the quantity owned, the database load is greatly diminished, and you can keep as many as you want! Only once a mod of this type is equipped onto a weapon does the challenge reveal itself, making the Riven apply to your account cap. This is a particularly useful change for Sorties, as you will no longer be locked out of playing them if you are at your maximum Riven cap.\nA confirmation screen will appear after attempting to equip the Riven, and will display the amount of Riven slots you have available before you commit to equipping it and using up a slot.\nAcquisition of new Riven mods from Vendors and other reward drops now give Indistinct Rivens.\nWe have made some changes to Unairu’s Passive ‘Last Gasp’ to improve its convenience and usability.\nLast Gasp meter now starts at 0% instead of 50%, but there is no initial drain. Instead, drain will set in after a few seconds of not getting any kills. Once the drain has run for a few seconds, it will begin to accelerate. \nThis was intended to address players remaining in Last Gasp indefinitely by timing their kills. Each kill now fills the meter by 1/3, and Eximus kills refill the meter instantly. \nYou can now hold the Transference input to return to your downed Warframe.\nThe UI has been updated to communicate these changes. \nRemoved ‘get up’ animation when reviving in Last Gasp. \nStopped looping sound when Last Gasp ends. \nReduced the spawn animation of Last Gasp.\n\nThis is a follow up to other Solar Rail Junction changes we have made this year, specifically in Update: 31.5 and Hotfix 31.6.4. As part of the same initiative to improve new player progression through the Junctions, this batch of changes has a predominant focus on the unreliable difficulty level of Specters; they do far too much damage but also have very low health, so either you get nuked to oblivion or vice versa. In an effort to level out the playing field, we have done a review of the biggest pain point Specters and made adjustments.\nAdded a short title card intro after triggering the panel and before combat begins to introduce the Specter of that Junction. \nAdded a boss health bar in the UI for Junction Specters. \nSwapped Volt Specter Junction location (Venus to Mercury) with Rhino Specter (Earth to Venus). \nVolt Specter is easier overall (due to his abilities being more obviously telegraphed), and was therefore more fitting of an earlier Junction. \nRemoved ragdoll on Specters when defeated. \nThe cinematic for activating a Solar Rail will now play (can be skipped if desired) on Junction replay, even if it has already been completed. \nFixed loss of functionality when downed by a Specter, triggering Last Gasp. \nFixed the Junction Specter ragdoll stopping after the Junction Specter has been defeated.\nLoki (Earth to Mars)\nIncreased his base health from 160 to 180.\nTrinity (Mars to Ceres)\nReduced her level from 20 to 15. \nReduced her Melee and Primary weapon damage. \nIncreased her armor from 200 to 215.\nValkyr (Ceres to Jupiter)\nAdded a max active time of 10s to the Valkyr Specter’s Hysteria ability.\nNova (Jupiter to Europa)\nRemoved Nova Specter's Molecular Prime ability. \nIt simply did not telegraph well, which resulted in increased damage on players without much notice. \nReduced the amount of damage done from Nova's Kunai secondary. \nNova Specter will now cast her Worm Hole ability in specifically placed waypoints located around the Junction room.\nIncreased the rate at which the Nova Specter uses her Worm Hole ability.  \nMoved the Nova Specter’s spawn point slightly forward.\nEmber (Jupiter to Saturn)\nReduced the Ember Specter’s level from 25 to 20. \nReduced the damage and fire rate of the Ember Specter’s Magnus secondary.\nEquinox (Saturn to Uranus)\nReduced the Equinox Specter’s level from 30 to 25.\nFrost (Uranus to Neptune)\nRemoved the Frost Specter's Avalanche ability.\nThis proved to be too powerful an ability for the Frost Specter, as it would freeze players on the spot and frequently resulted in being one shot by the Specter. \nMade tweaks to Frost Specter's ability stats. \nIncreased cooldown duration for his abilities. \nIncreased path damage for Ice Wave.\nAs mentioned on Devstream #163, we have made changes to the Gilding system to make it easier to access the full power of your Modular items earlier on in-game. For those players that have just completed the Second Dream and are looking to craft a more powerful Amp to help you into and beyond The New War \nthese changes are for you!\nInstead of upon Gilding, modular weapons will now have their full stats available upon ranking up to Level 30. Gilding your Modular weapon now serves the purpose of allowing it to earn Mastery and unlock customization. This allows players to have access to more powerful gear without needing to fully level and earn Standing for the respective Syndicates!\n\n\nIn Update 31.5: Angels of the Zariman, we made changes to Operator Transference to make it Client-Authoritative to alleviate the common scenario of latency. After the change was made, players noted that there was now a cooldown in between Transferences that was causing delays when performed back to back. We have made improvements so that the cooldown is much less felt. It is worth noting that there are still some idle animation bugs that can happen at zero cooldown, but the improvement will be noticeable regardless.\n\nOn the introduction of Overguard, we mentioned that we would be improving how some ability mechanics function with Overguard, this is a continuation of those efforts. So we have made several changes, the majority of which cover how Overguard reacts with lifesteal.\nFixed Garuda's Blending Talons Augment not triggering when hitting an enemy with Overguard is affected by a Slash Status Effect.\nFixed Gauss's Kinetic Plating not generating battery when melee attacking enemies with Overguard.\nFixed Protea's Temporal Anchor not counting damage to Overguard when building up damage for the temporal implosion blast.\nFixed Zephyr's Tailwind Target Fixation Augment not counting enemies with Overguard when building up extra damage.\nFixed Hema not restoring health on headshots against enemies with Overguard.\nFixed Hirudo not restoring health on critical hits against enemies with Overguard.\nFixed enemies affected by Frost’s Avalanche not losing any armor while Overguard is active.\nIf there are any other cases where Lifesteal isn’t applying from Overguard, please let us know on the Forums and we will take a look!\n\nWith Baro Ki’Teer’s inventory fully synced on all platforms, the team has progressed toward the following Cross Play objective: syncing all world-state content. This sync includes everything from Sorties, Void Fissures, Day/Night cycle, Town Vendors, Bounties, and everything in between that has a timer system. Additionally, the Relays active/destroyed on PC now apply to the console Star Chart, making them synced across the board. We had aspirations to do a “Relay Rebuilding” event, but to get Cross Play sooner than later, we’ve decided to forgo that idea.\nOur next objective is the public Cross Play test between select Platforms to gather feedback and bugs. Expect news about those tests, hopefully soon!\nWe’ve updated the 2FA “thank you for enabling” item from the Fae Path Ephemera to a 3-Day Affinity Booster.\nDue to the inability to enable 2FA on consoles, the Fae Path Ephemera became a Baro Ki’teer item on consoles as a way for them to obtain it. With Baro Ki’Teer’s inventory now synced across the board, swapping the 2FA reward was essential to us to continue advocating for players to enable it\n\nThese armor pieces are equippable on both Warframes and Kahl:\nSorex Chest Plate\nSorex Shoulder Guards\nSorex Leg Guards\nThese armor pieces are available for purchase directly in the in-game Market.\nNote that while we are only releasing one of the Sisters of Parvos sets initially shown in the art for the Sisters of Parvos update, our goal is to have all three sets available in the future!\n\nIgnis Wraith Research is now available to all Clans!\nTake a trip down memory lane with me as we travel back to 2017. Operation: The Pacifism Defect event concludes, and the top 10% of Clans in their tier are awarded the Research for the Ignis Wraith. Fast forward to 2022, and Research remains within those Clans, showing some unfortunate side effects of Trading manipulation. After internal discussion, the team decided to add the Ignis Wraith Research to all Clans with some rules:\nIgnis Wraith Blueprint Research requires the Clan to have a Rank of 10 and will be three times more expensive \nwe believe it’s vital that Clans earn the Research for those who did not place in the Operation.\nIgnis Wraith Blueprint is now untradable \nprotecting players from Trade manipulation who might be unaware that it’s now available in Clan Research.\nIgnis Wraith Blueprint's sell price is now equal to the acquire price of 15,000 Credits \nAllowing those who might have stockpiled Blueprints for Trading purposes to make back their Credits.\nAdded an \"Accept All\" option in the Pending section of the Clan Menu to allow you to approve all pending Clan join requests.\nRemoved the automatic message notifying members that a player has been kicked, has left, or has been rejected from the Clan.\nAdded a toggle while in the Dojo to toggle the Map visibility. \nMissed note from previous hotfixes: Added ability to toggle character shadows while in  the Dojo. \nFixed the cancel button not being visible when visiting a Clan Ad screen for the first time from the Clan screen. \nAlso fixed two loading spinners appearing when loading into the Clan AD screen. \nFixed issues of the Starlight Market Dojo room clipping into other rooms.\nFixed controller input binding missing to expand the Legend list in the Dojos.\n\nOperator Energy pickups will now be shared with Warframe. \nNote that this won’t affect Warframe mods that trigger certain conditions off energy pick-up while in Operator mode (ie.

  "fixes": "\nAlthough The New War is largely over, Narmer’s enslavement of the Origin System continues. But who is in control of Narmer now? Many Grineer and others remain imprisoned and helpless under the crushing influence of the Narmer Veil.\nEnter Kahl-175. Having survived his brush with the Sentients, and now free from their shackles, he emerges as the Origin System’s newest savior. Wield his explosive Grineer armaments as you race against time to rescue your Brothers from Narmer’s oppressive clutches. Battle Archons alongside your Squadmates, meet the 50th Warframe Styanax*, take on all-new Missions, bend time with the Protea Caladrius Collection, and much more!\nThis update also has a heavy focus on Quality of Life (QOL) changes including a rework to Spearguns, the three starter Warframes (Excalibur, Mag, and Volt), improvements to Riven database collecting, a whole slew of  Warframe Augment Mod buffs, and more to be discovered below.\n\n\nWith Veilbreaker comes a weekly approach to the systems introduced in this update. We want a variety of options for players to plan Daily, Weekly, and Evergreen goals.\nWith this goal of polishing comes the compromise that some of the rewards are also delayed a week, but we would rather have a more enjoyable experience vs. a rushed one. What that means for you is the free-path items through the new Chipper character, such as new Kahl cosmetics, new Mods, Styanax blueprints, new weapon blueprints etc., will be accessible when Kahl’s Break Narmer weekly missions begin. These missions are the only path to obtaining Stock, the currency used in Chipper’s offerings.\nOnce you have completed the Veilbreaker introductory quest, the following gameplay systems become available:\n* More detailed information on the above systems is provided in dedicated sections below.\n\nKahl-175 returns! In this solo introductory quest, witness the state of the Origin System following the events of The New War through the perspective of Grineer Lancer Kahl-175. Though Narmer’s leadership was shattered by the Tenno, many have yet to escape the Veil’s influence. With a new devotion to his Grineer brothers, Kahl partners with an unlikely ally to rescue those still imprisoned.\nCompleting the quest will reward you with the Archon Shard Helminth Segment Blueprint to install on your Helminth.\n\nUpon completion of the Quest, Tenno will gain access to KAHL’S GARRISON, a new Syndicate located in the Drifter’s Camp on Earth. Next week you’ll get access to Rank up with this Syndicate by completing weekly Garrison Assignments to unlock new vendors in the camp, and customize Kahl with earned customizations.\nGarrison Assignments are one-per-week solo missions available at Kahl in the Drifter’s Camp. Play as Kahl to continue his heroic task of freeing more victims from the Veil.\nThere are three unique Kahl driven missions accessible through Garrison Assignments. Additional challenges are presented during these Assignments and are optional to complete. Completing these challenges rewards a new currency called Stock (more on this below) that can be spent in Kahl’s Garrison.\nEach week's Break Narmer Assignment can be replayed throughout that week for more chances to complete the optional challenges.\nFour new Somarchord Songs are available to unlock by finding Somachord Fragments located throughout Garrison Assignment missions.\nFINAL STAND\nHOLD THE LINE\nSKYBREAK\nSTEEL HORIZON\nSince Kahl is not equipped with a scanner of his own, these Fragments can be collected by interacting with them to pick up.\nThis Syndicate auto-ranks with weekly gameplay progress rather than needing Standing! Unlocking ranks means building up the Garrison with new faces and opportunities.\n\nNew Archon Warframe Mods\nKahl Customizations\nFog of War Ephemera \nStyanax Components\nVarious Weapon Blueprints\nArchon Shards\n\nA new collection of Warframe Mods has landed in Kahl’s Garrison! They offer an increase of core stats with added effects for elemental damage dealing abilities.\n\n*Stats shown below are all at max rank.\nLikewise note that this currently has issues with some abilities that “heal over time” or trigger a heal after the ability is already running, we’ll be making improvements to this one as well.\n\nKahl’s Garrison will be present in your Drifter Camp following the completion of the Veilbreaker Quest. Visit Kahl-175 there and refresh his uniform with a variety of customization options. Equipped with Voidshell technology and a variety of Helmet and Attachment options, players can kit him with a unique look that would make his Brothers proud.\nLeg, shoulder, and chest Armor you own can also be equipped on Kahl!\n\nFace veiled opponents as you navigate familiar locations through Narmer-controlled parts of the Origin System. In an Archon Hunt, Tenno must complete three missions of increasing difficulty with additional restrictions. Only one Archon Hunt is available each week, so players can try their hand at completing it solo, or tackling it with a squad. For every player in the squad, enemies grow in strength (+50% Health and Shields per). While the Archon Hunt can be replayed, the rewards will only drop once.\nThese missions are intended to be challenging, so select your loadouts carefully to overcome your obstacles and take down your opponents.\n*The team is aware and investigating a bug where the Archons will sometimes take exorbitant amounts of damage; we are looking to resolve this soon.\n\nFixed the Chemtank Syandana’s liquid FX clipping through its tank. \nFixed Lavos Kuvael Alchemist Helmet missing liquid FX: the artist’s original intent was for liquid to be inside the helmet. \nFixed being unable to change the energy color of the Revenant Tenebrus Helmet. \nFixed being unable to color the glass on the Gara Adora Helmet. \nFixed the Lumis Oculus resting higher on the Drifter’s face than the Operator’s. \nFixed being unable to change the energy color of the Kalynex Polearm skin. \nFixed several offset issues with the Lamassu Shoulder Armor.\n\n\n\nFixed getting punted out of the room when defeated by Specter. \nFixed combat music not resetting when defeated by Specter. \nFixed the kneel animation dissolving on a loop when Specter has been defeated. \nFixed companion not being revived and teleported back to you at the spawn point after being defeated by Specter. \nFixed Specter kneeling animations for bulkier Warframes to prevent their hands from clipping through themselves.\nFixed Khora’s Whipclaw passing through enemies at 2-9m range (which made enemies very difficult to hit if you are aiming at them) and causing the explosion to occur behind them.\nFixed Titania’s Razorflies always facing the same direction.

While the Medallion system itself is not new, the Zariman tilesets spurred conversations around individual vs team wide pickups due to the grandeur size of the tilesets themselves. The feedback we received from the community expressed pain points related to necessary backtracking in order to collect the Plumes, which meant deviating from the Objective and causing longer than necessary mission times in order to collect them all. Similar pain points were what brought forth the squad-wide pickup change to Railjack.\n\nAs an additional lateral change, Riven Challenges for Syndicate Medallion collecting have been changed to be Solo specific and the amount reduced to 8-12 instead of 12-16. Already existing Rivens won’t adopt this change but will instead lose any complicated conditions and just be “Find X Medallions”.\n\nWhile maintaining our original intentions to connect Railjack to some more ‘core Warframe’ style rewards, we’ve made a few changes to have Ash components be more new player friendly for those starting their Railjack journey. Having them live only in Rotation C brought feedback of accessibility concerns for newer players trying to complete their Ash build. While Oberon parts do drop in new player friendly areas, having his Neuroptics reside within the Veil Proxima was a steep climb to have a chance at collecting all the parts you need.\nAdded Ash components to Corpus Railjack Exterminate/Volatile (4.82 \n4.88% chance), reducing Endo drops slightly. \nAdded Ash components to Corpus Railjack Survival/Defense Rotation A (13.33% chance), reducing Endo drops slightly & rearranging the drop % of rotation C.\nMoved Oberon Neuroptics from Veil Proxima to Earth, reducing Endo drops slightly and rearranging the drop %.\n\nReplaced the duplicate Meso H2 Relic dropping in Tier 2 Defense with the correct Meso H3 Relic. \nYou can now search for Incarnon weapons in your Inventory by typing “Incarnon”. \nRemoved the Necramech 'Engine Low Power' sound due to excessive repetition when using it for a long time at low power \nwarning will now only occur when the engine is fully depleted.\nAdjusted the Peculiar Audience Mod sounds to have more prominent laughing. \nAdjusted textures of Orokin Heavy Gunner Arctic Eximus so it doesn't use Blitz Eximus textures.\n\n",

We’ll see you on the 16th, Tenno!\n\nInsert Disc 2.\n\"It's that time again, Dreamers.\"\nLike previous editions of Nightwave, we have included duplicate protection for rewards that you have already unlocked. Identical to Nora’s Mix Vol. 1, Tenno can expect to be compensated with Nora’s Mix Vol. 2 Creds instead of the previous unlocked reward.\nWe are including 3 new Weekly Acts and 1 new Elite Weekly Act for those returning home. If you know... you know.\nNew weekly Acts include...\nEternal Guardian\nComplete 3 Void Armageddon missions.\nHigh Ground\nComplete 3 Void Flood Missions.\nZariman Bounty Hunter\nComplete 4 different Bounties in the Zariman.\nFallen Angel\nDefeat 5 Void Angels in the Zariman.*This can be achieved either solo or while in a squad. If your squad defeats the Void Angel, every member will have the Act completed, regardless of if they dealt the final blow.\nFor any Tenno that have not yet completed Angels of the Zariman, these challenges are hidden to prevent any potential spoilers! We have also removed the Elite Weekly Act ‘Silent Eliminator’ which required you to complete a level 30 Exterminate without triggering alarms.\nA mix of new rewards are coming alongside a hand-picked selection of rewards from previous Nightwave series!\nNightwave Ship Decoration\nA mini-decoration of the Nightwave Landing Craft.\nNoggle Statue \nNora Night\nA small statue of a person larger than life.\nNora Night Glyph Pack\nComplete your profile with a pair of Nora Night Glyphs \n“Style baby!”\nWeapon Augments (stats below are shown at max rank)\nCritical Precision (Tiberon): Burst Fire Only: Headshots increase Critical Chance by 10% up to 500%. Missing with all shots in a burst removes up to 100% of this bonus Critical Chance. \nVile Discharge (Embolist): Damage is accumulated up to 30,000. Use Alt-fire to launch an explosive vile sac dealing and resetting the accumulated damage.\nNightwave Operator Collection\nNora’s got the goods for you lucky Dreamers with this stylish collection of the Nightwave Suit, Sleeves, and Leggings.\nNightwave Earpieces\nA fashionable accessory only a Tenno could adorn.\nNecramech Statue\nAdorn your Orbiter with this decoration representing a Necramech.\nThe following items have also been added to the Cred Offerings shop:\nNightwave Ornament \nA decoration for all you Dreamers out there.\nGyre Automaton Helmet Blueprint \nElectrifying style coming in hotter than lighting!\nRiven Disposition Changes: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1316039-july-2022-riven-dispositions/\nAs with each round of Prime Access come updated Riven Disposition numbers \ntune into TennoCon on July 16th to learn who is the next Prime Warframe!\nLohk Surge buffs will now apply to the whole squad instead of only when within Affinity Range of the player who activates it. \nEnergy and Health Orbs can now be picked up, even if you have maxed out Energy, during the “Any Energy Orbs picked up grant 1 Energy per second for the rest of the mission” and “Any Health Orbs picked up grant 25 max Health for the rest of the mission” Lohk Surge buffs.\nReduced the price of the Kubrow Starter Kit from 65 Platinum to 50.  \nStasis Slots and DNA Stabilizers were removed from the game in Update 28 and also from the Kubrow Starter Kit, but the price was not adjusted to reflect this change. That said, we will be running a script to refund the 15 Platinum difference for players that had purchased the pack after the changes on June 11th, 2020. We will update here when the script has completed. \nThe Hystrix now has signature effect of an 8% chance to instantly reload after landing headshots when wielded by Khora.\nThe Dual Keres now has a 20% Heavy Attack Efficiency when wielded by Khora.\nKuva Trokarians are now susceptible to CC abilities after their Overguard protection has been removed.\nBy design, Kuva Trokarians pre-Overguard had immunities/resistances from another source outside of Overguard that were still active once it was removed by players. They now follow the same logic as other enemies with Overguard.\nSwapped the Saryn Junction Specter sniper rifle for a different rifle type that has been balanced for AI.\nSwapped the Frost Specter (Earth-Mars) and Loki Specter (Uranus-Neptune). \nSwapped the Landing Craft ‘Orokin Eye’ Air Support icon for marked loot from the default marker to the Orokin Eye icon. \nRadiation Hazard will no longer appear with Interception mission Sorties.\nIt is simply just not fun for everyone to get Radiation proc’d while all standing together to capture a tower.\nAdded a marker to Warframe impaled by Void Angel for better visibility. \nImproved hit detection when damaging the Void Angel ground spike.\nMade micro-optimizations to game & engine startup.\nMade systemic optimizations to memory usage throughout the game on all platforms.\nMade micro-optimizations to memory footprint for all platforms. \nOptimized memory footprint for large levels.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed the Phenmor’s “50% more Incarnon charge on headshots” Evolution IV perk not working. \nCharging to Incarnon mode was taking 12 hits regardless of if you had this Evolution perk or not. Now, charging will take 12 hits if you do not have this perk, and 8 hits if you do. \nFixed stackable buffs for Galvanized Scope/Crosshair being removed all at once when the first stack's time runs out.\nAlso fixed Arcanes that have decaying stacks losing all their bonus when a stack expires. \nFixed being unable to use manual blocking while in melee-only mode, or use aim+attack melee combos, unless you are also using the ‘Hold to Aim Weapon’ in the Accessibility options. \nWe reverted back to its original functionality where melee could toggle into blocking mode when ‘Hold to Aim Weapon’ was disabled. \nFixes towards Railjack crew members assigned to Pilot not trying to destroy mission targets while you’re away.\nThis may still occur rarely but it’s a different issue than the bug which caused them to never try at all. We’d appreciate your videos and detailed bug reports if you encounter POIs that crew members do not correctly engage.\nFixed an issue where jumping out of a mantle animation wouldn't give you any vertical velocity.\nPreviously, if you came across a scalable object, your Warframe would attempt to climb over the object. Pressing the jump button during this action would cause your Warframe to somersault downwards and fall. We have now adjusted the animation to propel the Warframe upwards to allow you to easily climb over the object and maintain your momentum.\nFixed more issues with Skittergirl pathing in the Zariman tileset.\nFixed Rank 3 or above Molt Augmented and Molt Reconstruct Arcanes not giving extra Warframe revives.\nAlso fixed the Molt Arcanes and Arcane Pulse not indicating that they will give an extra Warframe revive at Rank 3 and up. \nAlso fixed an issue where being over capacity on mods was unforgiving, preventing even mods with zero drain from applying (ex. arcanes).\nFixed “Can Refresh” label appearing in the UI for Arcanes that do not have a Duration element to it. \nFixed the stat change for  Incarnon weapons that have crit/status chance Evolution upgrades not appearing in the Arsenal. \nFixed the Emergence Savior Arcane giving Clients immortality after they die instead of triggering on death.  \nFixed the Cascadia Empowered Arcane buffs applying to Companion or Sentinel weapons.\nFixed an additional filter option appearing in Captura while using a controller. \nFixed loss of functionality due to poor connection when Client dies in Necramech. \nFixed Clients getting stuck in a black screen indefinity after Host Migration in Zariman missions. \nFixed Clients getting permanently stuck in the Zariman elevator if they abort when the Void Angel’s Health bar spawns. \nFixed another case of back to back Zariman Extermination missions auto completing after Host migration occurs in the first mission.  \nFixed hitting a fish with the wrong spear causing them to be indefinitely uncatchable afterwards. \nFixed being unable to pick up Energy Orbs after casting Zephyr’s Airburst while Zenurik’s Inner Might is active. \nFixed skins applying to the Innodem’s Incarnon mode form. \nFixed issues where enemies may prefer to jump up and down to cross the elevator shaft, instead of just going around on the same level in the Zariman tileset. \nMore fixes towards cases where an Arbitration Drone's aura might persist even after it was destroyed. \nFixed Raptor not spawning in its Assasination mission if Host migration occurs after it appears for the first time. \nFixed sound settings not being respected when driving over water with K-Drive. Splish splash was too loud. \nFixed descriptions for Lohk Surges in-mission appearing as stars when playing in certain languages. \nFixed certain Blink Pads in open landscapes losing functionality. \nFixed the left Kukri Prime Leg Guard offset appearing weirdly on Saryn Prime and various of her skins. \nFixed the Protovyre Leg Armor clipping through Harrow Prime. \nFixed Prosecutor enemies being incorrectly named as ‘Guardian Eximus’ in the Simulacrum menu.  \nFixes towards rare cases where the launcher might show negative download size left when certain types of network error interrupt the download.\nFixed Dojo levels reloading after placing/canceling a new room and not spawning the player in front of the door for said room. \nFixed an issue where the Molt from the Saryn Junction Specter would stay behind after the player respawns, causing her to target it instead of the player. \nFixed another case of the Thrax Centurion going into an invulnerable crouch state instead of going into their Void form. \nFixed the Arcanes in Cavalero’s Offerings appearing under the ‘Mods’ category. As reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1314743-cavalero-shop-has-the-wrong-category/\nFixed the Drekar Ballista missing arms. \nFixed a certain spot in the Grineer Sealab tileset resetting Warframe to a new spawn point face down. \nFixed doors not opening to go back up to the surface during the Exploiter Orb fight. \nAlso fixed crash related to this. \nFixed script error that could occur when activating an enemy encounter in the Orb Vallis. \nFixed script error when building the Operator Vahd Apparel blueprint in the Foundry.\nFixed script error with Vauban’s Tesla Nervos. \nFixed script error with Lohk Surges. \nFixed script error with custom UI themes. \nFixed script error when casting Nidus’ Ravenous in the Simulacrum and then switching Warframes via Arsenal before the Maggots explode. \nFixed script error with Harrow’s Penance. \nFixed script error with the Railjack Phoenix Blaze Battle mod. \nFixed script error with Saryn’s Toxic Lash. \nFixed script error with Landing Craft Air Support. \nFixed script error caused by players exiting/disconnecting during the forced transference process when entering the Void Angel's portal.\nFixed script error when closing Codex. \nFixed script error when capturing Conservation animals. \nFixed script error with Chroma’s Effigy.\n",

  "changes": "Updated the Incarnon Form charge gauge in the Incarnon weapon reticle to improve readability on when there is charge/when it is at full charge. \nThe Phenmor can now equip owned Rifle skins! \nThe Laetum and the Praedos were released with this option enabled, it is now the Phenmor’s turn! \nUpdated Incarnon Weapon Evolution screen to include stat comparisons when selecting Evolution perks in Cavalero’s evolve screen. From the original known bugs list.\nChanged Laetum’s ‘Overwhelming Attrition’ Evolution duration from 20 to 10 seconds.\nOverwhelming Attrition was simply too powerful to justify using the other two Tier 5 Evolutions for the Laetum. This change was made to encourage build diversity for the Laetum. \nMade some slight adjustments to framing of Incarnon weapons in Cavalero’s Evolution screen. \nUpdated Praedos transformation Sound with Void FX.\nFixed cases where the Laetum and the Phenmor were not counting headshots for Incarnon Form charge. \nFixed the Laetum’s \"Overwhelming Attrition\" Evolution perk triggering much less frequently for Clients than for Hosts. \nIf any projectile in the multishot group was a critical hit or status effect, the entire thing became invalid and would not get the buff for Clients.\nFixed Clients gaining Incarnon Form charges added and then partially resetting and counting back up in high latency situations. \nFixed the Laetum’s Evolution V ability “Devouring Attrition” not providing its 50% chance of receiving a 2000% damage buff on non-critical hits for Clients. \nFixed Incarnon weapons using Skins in Incarnon form. From the original known bugs list.\nFixed Laetum Reaper’s Plenty Evolution applying to all equipped weapons.\nFixed cases of Evolution perks not working for Clients. \nFixed the transformation timing on the Phenmor Evolution which cut off the sound FX.\nFixed Incarnon Evolutions UI persisting in the Loadouts screen. \nFixed the Praedos’ Evolution III challenge working on non-Thrax enemies.\n*All values below are shown at Rank 5. As always, values that were shown on Devstream #162 were subject to change and that is reflected below as further considerations and testing was done.\n\nThe Amp Arcane Adapter fuses with an Amp to unlock an additional Arcane Slot. These can be purchased with Holdfast Standing from Cavalero.\nTo install the Amp Arcane Adapter and unlock an additional Slot, go to your Operator Equipment > Select the Amp you wish to unlock an additional Slot > Select the ‘Locked’ slot and hit “ok” to install the Amp Arcane Adapter.\nWith the addition of several new Amp Arcanes with Angels of the Zariman and Echoes of the Zariman, this new Slot allows you to make the most of your growing Arcane collection!\nThis new Arcane slot is only visible in the Operator Equipment screen once the Angels of the Zariman quest has been completed since Cavalero must be visited in the Chrysalith to get the Amp Arcane Adapter.\n\nCavalero has also updated his wares with new Ephemeras that are very inspired by Void Angel and Void Energy designs. Purchase the Blueprints for Standing and craft them to imbue yourself with the ethereal nature of the Void.\n\nNEW: VOID’S SONG SHAWZIN\nKira played her shawzin to uplift the spirits of Zariman crewmembers. Her song and her memory live on in the Void.\nThis Shawzin has breathy airy tones, and can be purchased for Platinum via the in-game Market!\n\nThe Parallax can be purchased via the in-game Market for Platinum or players can craft it by purchasing its Blueprint for Credits and finding its component blueprints via the Reinforced Carrypods located in the Zariman.\nThe Parallax also has 4 skins available for purchase in the in-game Market! They can each be purchased separately or in the Parallax Landing Craft Collection.\n*Players who own the Parallax can equip its Orokin Eye Air Support on their other Landing Crafts.\n\nWe have added multidirectional movement to Void Sling!\n\n\nWe made some improvements to the Operator projection positioning tech so that it produces a more accurate result of the final position where the Operator can pass through. This should help alleviate scenarios where the Operator could appear to Void Sling under a door but instead bonked their head. More work will be done to improve in other areas, notably issues with the Operator’s lower half colliding with the environment during Void Sling travel (we’ve got some broken ankles on the court).\n\nAdded Operator Stats to the Operator Customization screen.\nUpdated the Anti-Warframe field (Exolizers in Void Cascade and Kuva Trokarian’s Anti-Warframe Grenades) to no longer nullify Warframe abilities on forced Transference. As mentioned in the Hotfix 31.5.10 notes.\nUpdated the FX on Zenurik’s Temporal Drag. \nChanged Temporal Drag and Temporal Shot so that only one damage number pops up when headshotting a slowed enemy. \nThe reason behind this change simply is less damage number pop-up spam and consistency with other damage buffs across the game. Precision headshot damage buffs, for example, buff the damage on headshots but only display the one aggregated damage number per shot. Before this change, headshotting enemies affected by Temporal Drag would show two damage numbers, one for the base damage and one for the bonus. Now it will behave exactly like normal precision headshot buffs, only it will be conditional on the target enemy being slowed by the Temporal Drag ability. \nTemporal Shot’s bonus headshot damage on targets can now be affected by another player’s Temporal Drag. \nSlightly reduced Caustic Strike’s opacity FX from enemies that enter the bubble.  \nNote on Transference cooldown progress: We mentioned during Devstream #162 that the slight Transference cooldown is not intended. And that continues to be the case \nbut the changes are not situated well enough yet to release as it involves careful consideration around server tech that we have to be delicate around. Work continues for a future release! \nFixed Temporal Drag not using chosen Energy colors. \nFixed certain Operator Hairstyles appearing with black dots while using the Enhanced Graphics Engine. \nUpdated Operator Amp animations to be one handed when shooting and aiming. \nFixed Magnetic Flare lasting 30 seconds across all Ranks instead of scaling with level as intended. \nFixed Unairu Wisp only being spawned if the target is vulnerable to Caustic Strike. \nThe wisp will spawn even if the target cannot have their armor removed by Caustic Strike. \nFixed being unable to choose the Transfererence option using the ‘Next/Previous Power’ and ‘Use Selected’ input bindings (5 on Keyboard or left/right bumpers on controller). \nFixed being able to clip into walls in certain tilesets using Transference. \nFixed being able to clip through closed doors in the Dormizone using Transference. \nFixed bug where getting grabbed by Ropalolyst when in Last Gasp, or entering Last Gasp while in Ropalolyst grab, would cause players to be invulnerable and unable to use Transference.\nFixed being unable to use the Melee button to Transference back into Warframe if the ‘Use Abilities on Selection’ option is disabled. \nThis ultimately fixes being unable to use Naramon’s ‘Opening Slam’ and ‘Killer Rush’. \nThis also fixes being unable to do Mercy finishers on enemies when triggered as Operator. \nFixed being unable to swap Focus schools in the Simulacrum as Client.\nFixed rare Crash occurring from using Temporal Drag.  \nFixed an issue where toggling Void mode while your spectral form is traveling would disable knockdown invulnerability and damage reduction. \nFixed Health not returning to normal amounts after Transference Static wears off. \nFixed Warframe animations appearing while customizing the Operator.\nFixed issue of Amp customization only affecting Operator appearance.\nFixed Voidshell materials not applying to both versions of the Voidshell suit when customizing in the Arsenal. \nFixed crash when attempting to copy Operator suit colors to Sirocco. \nFixed error upon opening the Amp customization screen. \nFixed the description for the Zariman Sleeves on the Operator outfit. \nFixed Spoiler character using weapon animations while in the Dormizone.\nFixed the Spoiler character waistband appearing underneath them.\nFixed wonky arm animations while hip firing as Operator. \nFixed bug where \"player was revived\" message would show in the HUD when a player with a pet equipped activated Last Gasp. Also fixed \"Player is down\" message also showing when being forced back to downed Warframe.\nFixed Transferencing in and out of the Operator on the Orbiter removing the player's ability to open the pause menu.\nFixed script error when using Transference while being Switch Teleported by a Kuva Lich.\nModified Overguard ratios to bring Eximus Units Overguard down and slightly increase their Health/Shields to balance out the reduction.  \nReduced Eximus Overguard by 50% and transferred the 50% to their Health pool. \nWhile this may read as a big increase to the Health pool, it is not a 1-to-1 trade due to the overall pool sizes of Overguard vs Health. Imagine you have a watermelon (Overguard) and half an orange (Health). I take away half a watermelon and I give you half an orange \nand together we eat a fruit salad. For clarity: Overguard has a larger pool than Health, so reducing it by half still amounts to less HP across Eximus Units across all HP values. By increasing the amount of Health and Shields an Eximus Unit has, it also increases the window for successful Mercy kills. \nIncreased Shield Scaling multiplier by 50%\nNox Eximus Helmets can now be destroyed when Overguard is active. Breaking their helmet will remove Overguard entirely!\nNote that Nox Damage resistance has been decreased and armor increased to balance this change. This change applies to both Nox Eximus and base Nox enemies. \nFixed Overguard counting as Health and taking damage from Viral Status Effect.\nOverguard situates itself in a new category of “protection”. It differs from Shields, Armor, and Health. That said, Viral Status Effects affecting Overguard was unintentional and has been changed to not only fit the original design for Viral damage, but also Overguard. \nWe originally mentioned in the Eximus Reborn Dev Workshop that the only Status Effect that would work on Eximus while Overguard is present is Cold Status Effects (up to 4 stacks!).\nBlitz Eximus damage is now more consistent:\nNow will only take 1 instance of damage per wave. Previously you could get knocked back into more explosions to take multiple subsequent hits.\nLifesteal now works on damage dealt to Overguard.\nConsidering Overguard is another health pool for an Eximus/Thrax and that Lifesteal already works on Health and Shields, Overguard is now susceptible to Lifesteal to give players another way to tactically engage with them. The fights with Eximus can be quite challenging, so having another avenue of survivability is always encouraged! \nThis change was also made in mind to Lifesteal survivability builds, it would be too difficult to lose all of your survivability when encountering many enemies with Overguard at one time (from either Void Armageddon or an Ancient Healer etc.) \nAdditionally, there are some Weapons and abilities that aren’t strictly classified as Lifesteal that won’t currently work, but will in a future update! This currently affects specific conditions for the:\nHema\nHirudo \nGaruda’s Blending Talons augment\nGauss’ Kinetic Plating \nProtea’s Temporal Anchor \nZephyr’s Target Fixation augment\nIf there are any other cases where Lifesteal isn’t applying from Overguard, please let us know on the Forums and we will take a look!\nEximus units no longer spawn at a higher level than the mission level. \nEximus spawning at increasingly higher levels felt unnecessary with the introduction of Overguard.\nKilled Eximus units now drop a guaranteed Energy Orb and 2 Health Orbs. \nThere is a known bug that this currently doesn’t apply to the Eximus units found in Onslaught game types\nFixed Arson Eximus blast attacks not hitting through Limbo’s Rift.\nFixed Baruuk being unable to damage Eximus units with his Serene Storm waves.\nTo ease the flow from Quinn to the Chrysalith elevator and vice versa, we have added portals!\nBefore: You would either have to run back and forth between the two or use a complex combination of Fast Travel menu hopping (Pause > Fast Travel > Quinn > Pause > Fast Travel > Zariman Navigation). This would interrupt gameplay flow when wanting to play back to back Bounties.\nNow: A portal will spawn after selecting a Bounty at Quinn, walking into it will take you to the elevator where you can load into the mission. After completing the Bounty, a portal will be available for you to use upon exiting the elevator that will take you right back to Quinn to select your next Bounty.\n\n\nThree Lohk Surges spawn throughout the tileset for players to find \neach with their randomized buff to activate! Upon finding it, the icon will reveal the buff it offers. Whenever you trigger it, it will spawn an Eximus that you have to defeat.\nThere are 7 possible temporary 45 second buffs that apply to both Warframe and Operator (buffs persist between Transference):\nSecondaries have guaranteed red crits.\nAny Health Orbs picked up grant 25 max Health for the rest of the mission.\nAny Energy Orbs picked up grant 1 Energy per second for the rest of the mission.\n1% life leech on all your damage and guaranteed bleed procs. \nNo Energy cost on abilities and increase casting speed.\n200% extra Affinity gain.\nInfinite ammo and 50% fire rate (affects Amps as well!).\nThere is a 10-minute cooldown for Lohk Surges after activating the buff, but once that’s finished you can go back and activate another Lohk Surge.\nLohk Surge challenges have also been added to the Zariman Bounties!\nReduced the Energy drain from Magnetic procs from 50 to 20 per tick. \nThis not only applies to Thrax enemies, but to Magnetic damage across the game (laser doors, magnetic water in the Plains of Eidolon, etc.)! A default Magnetic proc used to drain 250 Energy, now it will do 100. \nOverguard resistance/base amount will now show up on Thrax enemies in the Codex.\nAdjusted Thrax enemy spawns in Mobile Defense to scale based on the size of the squad:\nSolo: 2 Thrax spawns per Console \n2 Player squad: 3 Thrax spawns per Console \n3+ Player squad: 4 Thrax spawns per Console \nFor any Tenno not playing in a full squad, we found the Thrax spawns in Mobile Defense were far too difficult to manage either solo or with fewer Tenno. We’ve since scaled the spawns to compensate!\nFixed an issue with the Thrax Legatus’ beam damage tick rate being doubled. \nIf you were standing in its beam attack, the damage you receive would be astronomical, even at lower levels (Level 10 Legatus enemies could down a full health Valkyr in one beam attack). What was happening is that the Legatus would be dealing multiple instances of damage instead of constant single tick. This has now been resolved, so there should be no one hit wonders.\nFixed Thrax Legatus enemies being able to inflict Magnetic Status procs on Warframes with a Rank 5 Arcane Nullifier equipped (102% chance to resist Magnetic Status Effects entirely).\nVoidplumes can now be earned from Archimedean Yonta by trading in resources found throughout the Zariman! Voidplumes rotate every 8 hours, a Time Left to Trade timer is available to indicate the next upcoming rotation.\n\nAdded individual extraction to endless Zariman missions (Void Cascade, Void Flood, and Void Armageddon).\nIn order to solo extract from endless Zariman missions, simply head to the elevator and hold to extract at the panel. Traditionally, in other endless missions you could solo extract by waiting out the timer at the extraction point, but doing that here will only extract once all team members have joined you in the elevator. We may explore this option for Zariman missions, but for now manual solo extraction is available! \nAdded a 5th Tier Bounty category to the Zariman Bounties! \nThis also means that all Mission types will be available at one time via Bounties in the Chrysalith. \nThe Hespar and Aeolak Blueprints have also been split into separate Bounties, meaning these two rare rewards are now housed in their own independent Bounty table, instead of having both of them in one. \nThe Voidplume Quill amount for completing Bounty challenges has been increased by 1 for all Tier 3 and higher Bounties. \nVoidplume pickups will now count towards the Syndicate Medallion Riven challenge. \nKuva Trokarian enemies are receiving some changes to make them feel like more of a threat when they appear in-mission. \nSimilar to their Thrax compatriots, these foes are intended to add an extra level of difficulty to the player’s gameplay loop, so these tweaks are made with that goal in mind.\nAdded Overguard to the Kuva Trokarian (but at a lesser value than the Eximus Overguard)\nIncreased their Void Damage slightly. \nIncreased Armor from 250 to 300. \nIncreased base Health from 450 to 500. \nIncreased Affinity earned from killing a Kuva Trokarian from 500 to 750. \nAdded input callouts for the fast select turret options in Void Armageddon missions.\nAdded Chrysalith and Orbiter options when attempting to leave Zariman missions from the pause menu. \nAdded Chrysalith and Orbiter options when attempting to leave the Dormizone from the pause menu. \nThe Mission Select screen accessed in the Chrysalith will now mark which missions you have not completed as “Unexplored”. \nMade several minor changes to the audio volume in the Void Armageddon (Oro Works) mission. \nUpdated the audio for the Exodampers in Void Armageddon. \nUpdated the Seesaw physics in the Zariman for all of our Seesaw purists out there.\nFixed an issue where doors in the Zariman would not render, making it impossible to progress through the mission. From the original known bugs list. \nFixed glass material flickering if there is active VFX behind it (notably with the yellow Exolizer bubble in Void Cascade missions). \nFixed a small issue with the Armament turrets ambient VFX in Void Armageddon missions.  \nFixed certain Warframes (notably while using Yareli’s Merulina and Sevagoth’s Exalted Shadow) losing functionality and getting stuck in t-pose after entering the Void Cascade Exolizer anti-Warframe bubbles. \nFixed a missing water teleport volume in the Zariman Exterminate mission. \nFixed being able to escape Void Angel ground spikes by transferring back to Warframe immediately after being impaled as Client. \nThis also fixes remaining in the impaled pose animation wherever transference occurred. \nFixed pause menu lingering on-screen if a player is impaled by a Void Angel with it open. \nFixed a black panel with invisible collision in the Zariman tileset. \nFixed a crash related to Host migration while loading in through the Chrysalith elevator. \nFixed Zariman Bounties not being listed in the Codex as a drop source for Relics. \nFixed players being unable to matchmake to Steel Path Zariman nodes while in the Chrysalith mission select screen. As previously mentioned in the Hotfix 31.5.9 patch notes.\nFixed issues being caused by Vacuum picking up Argozene when the squad is already at maximum carry amount in Void Armageddon missions. \nFixed Clients crashing when attempting to load into an active Bounty stage if the Host aborted the mission after that stage or started a new Bounty. \nFixed Void Angel's ground spikes sometimes overshooting the target when they're moving slow.\nFixed Void Angels becoming invisible for Clients while going into their down state while also teleporting. \nFixed Void Angels teleporting into the ground.\nFixed Void Angels not appearing in their downed state to players who join in-progress missions. \nFixed unintentended tentacle-like VFX when deploying the armaments in Void Armageddon missions. \nFixed an issue with display distance calculations being inconsistent for Melica Cache minimap markers. \nFixed Clients being unable to see progress UI on turrets or crates in Void Armageddon.\nFixed black screen experienced when fast traveling to the Zariman navigation in the Chrysalith and immediately trying to load into an Exterminate mission. \nFixed Voidplumes not being grouped together in the End of Mission screen. \nFixed Zariman Bounty challenges resetting on fail after they’ve already been completed. \nFixed script error when attempting to /join a squad in a Zariman mission.\nFixed waypoint showing up for Clients to get to the Chrysalith elevator after selecting a Bounty. \nFixed the Grustrag Three breaking extraction in the elevator if they invade during Zariman missions. \nFixed certain loot markers in the Zariman not updating their position when you’re in minimap range of the destination, which was causing confusion as the markers would suddenly appear behind you. \nFixed being able to remove the Zariman Bounty objective mid-mission and still receive the Bounty completion reward regardless. \nFixed being unable to load into a Bounty using the Chrysalith elevator after aborting a mission using the panel in the elevator. \nFixed more issues related to the Void Angels impale ability across Hosts and Clients in a squad.\nFixed the Void Angel Bounty challenge remaining incomplete after completing successfully. \nFixed Zariman Bounties with objective timers resetting after the Host leaves and causing a Host migration. \nFixed Vitoplast VFX expanding outside of the Drone after Host migration in Void Flood mission. \nFixed Vitoplast VFX flashing for Clients after Host migrates in Void Flood mission. \nFixed migrating immediately upon the first rupture causing the second rupture to appear prematurely in Void Flood missions. \nFixed Skittergirl’s pathing being broken while traversing over very obvious jumpable bridges in the Zariman. \nFixed being able to leave the Zarium Accolade in the Elevator, allowing you to take it with you back to the Chrysalith.\nFixed Zariman Bounty description using plural text when only singular was needed.\nFixed issue of Turret lifespan UI flashing briefly for Clients in Void Armageddon. \nFixed repeat back-to-back Zariman Exterminate missions sometimes having the incorrect kill count and auto completing.\n\nYou can now fast travel in Open Landscapes (Plains of Eidolon, Orb Vallis, and Cambion Drift) using Blinkpads! Blinkpads can also be interacted with while in Archwing, but upon arrival you will be returned to foot so that you can choose your next mode of transportation.\nPlayers can teleport to other Blinkpads by interacting with ones they come across within the Landscape, or by selecting the Blinkpad they wish to travel to from their Advanced Map (accessed by holding their bound Show Level Map key).\n\n\nWe’ve adjusted the values of older Arcanes with the goal of making lower rank Arcanes more viable, and more desirable while collecting as a result. In short, there are three stats that each Arcane tends to have (speaking generally) -\nfor example, a percentage chance, a stat buff, and the duration of the buff.\nCertain Arcanes increase all of these stats per rank (making them scale exponentially), but we are changing it so that only one stat is affected by rank (making it scale linearly). The other stats will now be at the max-rank value regardless of the Arcane Rank, thereby buffing lower-rank Arcanes as a result.\nFor example, using Arcane Fury.\nPrevious: \nThe unranked values were as follows: “On Critical Hit: 10% chance for +30% Melee Damage to Melee Weapons for 3s”\nThe max rank values were as follows: “On Critical Hit: 60% chance for +180% Melee Damage to Melee Weapons for 18s”\nNew: \nWith these changes, the unranked values are as follows: “On Critical Hit: 60% chance for +30% Melee Damage to Melee Weapons for 18s”\nWith these changes, the max rank values remain the same as before: “On Critical Hit: 60% chance for +180% Melee Damage to Melee Weapons for 18s”\n*Arcane Barrier is the one true exception to the Arcane changes below, since it has two scaling stats, but one of those stats actually becomes worse with rank. Rank 3-4 for example increases the cooldown from 4s to 5s. So if we were to change it to have constant cooldown like the others, we would be increasing the cooldown duration for the lower ranks \nwhich is something we want to avoid! Any other possible changes might have to alter how the Arcane works overall, so we ultimately decided to leave it untouched.\nNow that the chance is guaranteed, the new description is “On Headshot: +10%/60% Parkour Velocity for 18s”\nNow that the chance is guaranteed, the new description is “On Headshot: +50%/300% damage for 18s on Secondary Weapon”\nNow that the chance is guaranteed, the new description is “On Finisher Kill: +200/1200 Armor for 45s”\n\nWe have also made the following changes to Emergence Dissipate: \nVoid Motes are no longer affected by ‘vortex’ abilities like Void Snare. \nAdded a 1.5 second delay between generating Void Mote from the same enemy. \nEmergence Dissipate was conceptualized as a weaker alternative to Zenurik’s energy gain, but ended up being even stronger than the Energy-focused school in certain cases, going against the Focus rework goals of each school having a unique niche. The above changes also seek to maintain the original goals we had with Void Sling; to encourage a more controlled behavior instead of a spam-centric loop. The slight cooldown motivates more mindful gameplay, but with the benefit of the stat buffs it has received for lower levels.\nNow that the chance is guaranteed, the new description is “WHILE IN VOID SLING: Press [fire input] to dissipate the endpoint in a 10m radius. Enemies hit create a short lived Void Mote that replenishes 5/10 energy on pick up.\nNow that the chance is guaranteed, the new description is “On Void Sling: +15%/90% Sprint Speed for 12s”\nNow that the chance is guaranteed, the new description is “On Void Sling: Heal 5%/30% Health”\n\nNow that the chance is guaranteed, the new description is “On Headshot Kill: +7.5%/30% Ability Efficiency and +7.5%/30% Ability Strength on the next Ability used within 4s”\nNow that the chance is guaranteed, the new description is “On Headshot Kill: 1/4 projectiles burst from the enemy and seek the heads of nearby enemies.”\n*As a bonus for the four Residual Arcanes above, we’ve added some extra improvements \nall four have had their buff radius increased to 9m, and each now has a 20% chance to proc their status type on all damage instances!\n\nWe have made the following changes to lighting to improve how it interacts with details in open landscapes!\nSeparated sky lighting from the rest in lightmaps, resulting in improved lighting quality because samples coming from opposite directions will no longer cancel each other out.\nLighting at night will now pop much more! Prior to this change, everything would be tinted in dark blue. Now, each lighting source will have much more vibrance in contrast to the dark backdrop of night.  \nLighting during the day will now have a lot more textural details especially when viewing things at distance. Prior to this change, details would tend to get lost at a distance and resemble more clay-like, without any grit or grain to it. \nAdded sun bounce to the enhanced graphics engine. \nEnhanced graphics engine also offers more detail at a distance.\n\nYou may also notice in the above image that we have also made foliage blend improvements.\n\nScorpions, Ancients, and Tusk Predators have had their grappling hook mechanic reworked! An age-old enemy mechanic from the early beginnings of Warframe, they’ve been grappling Tenno left and right for years \nit’s time to break free! Since its introduction, the grappling hook attack has consistently knocked players down or dragged them around, providing no opening for combative counterplay.\nNOW Scorpion, Ancient, and Tusk Predator grappling hooks will tether to you, followed by a slight delay (1 second) before they attempt to slowly pull you in. Tenno who are agile enough can now Melee attack in the direction of the rope to destroy it and stagger the enemy. Additionally, Bullet Jumping or dodging during the pulling animation can cause a stagger to the enemy.\n*Isolator Bursas have not received the cut mechanic since the mechanic works a bit differently for these enemies.\n\nDog Days Night Scene\nDog Days Kavat Glyph\nDog Days Kubrow Glyph\nFishy Ephemera\nThe event also features a new day and night cycle so you can test your soaking skills in the dark. Read up more about this tactical alert here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1313502-dog-days-returns-on-all-platforms/\nUpdated the context action UI! \nAdded a search bar to the Options menus! \n“New” tag in the in-game Market will no longer show for items you already own. \nUpdated several in-game Market bundle images. \nUpdated various Customization screens:\nRailjack Customization\nLanding Craft selection \nOrbiter Interior customization \nSpoiler character customization \nAdded darkening layer over in-game Market dioramas while scrolling through items so that the images are more prominent. \nAdded FX backdrop to equipped Arcanes in the Operator Equipment screen.\nChanged color on Amp Arcanes to all use the same green. \nWhen hovering over a bundle, the content icons will now rotate.\nUpdated Polish language Character support to display in the Star Chart properly.\nMade adjustments to Polish character text alignment to prevent cluttering.\nUpdated the Tenno Guide icon texture. \nAdded option to sort Friends list by most days spent Offline.\nUpdated Arcane icons back to being square.\nIncreased the size of the Syndicate screen in the Orbiter to accommodate larger text. \nInvulnerability icons on boss health bars will now only appear on health segments that have not been depleted. \nBefore: All segments got the icon no matter what.\nNow: Only segments that still have health get the icon.\nAdded a fade-in FX for current Requiem Mod combination and history in the Kuva Lich/Sister of Parvos screen in the Codex. \nAdded some UI flair to the Clan management screen:\nOn-hover icon enlargement to buttons.\nClan Rank icon has had some outer glow added to it. \nMessage of the Day graphic now has a fancy shimmer shader.\n\nMade systemic optimizations to memory footprint (approximately 40MB of RAM saved in the Orb Vallis). \nReduced memory consumption in DirectX 12 mode which helps towards fixing crashes on low-spec systems.

As reported here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/uigpd9/grendel_missions_impossible_now_with_eximus_rework/i7fk209/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&co\nThe changes to Eximus units in the Angels of the Zariman update made this particular mission much longer compared to the rest because you are required to clear all the Eximus at the end of every wave. Even with the changes we’ve made to Overguard in this update, we have reduced the waves to compensate for the added difficulty/time we found Eximus units continued to bring to the mission. \nSyndicate Death Squads will no longer spawn in the Grendel Locator missions. \nGaruda’s Dread Mirror now blocks all radial damage in front of it and grants stagger/knockdown immunity. \nChanged the reticle of several weapons with a charge mechanic to no longer use energy colors for their charge indicators.\nWhile it’s desirable to have the reticle of these weapons take on the energy color, it sacrifices too much clarity for the weapon charge indicator.\nThis applies to: \nLaetum transmutation gauge \nPhenmor transmutation gauge\nMorgha charge reticle\nCortege charge reticle\nSepulcrum charge reticle\nTrumna charge reticle\nMausolon charge reticle\nUpdated the description of Magus Nourish to indicate that it heals a set amount, and does not apply healing over time. \nThis is always how the Arcane has functioned, we are simply updating the description.\nTerminal Velocity is now compatible with the Aeolak. \nAdded abilities videos to the Necramech abilities screen. \nAdded new ‘Premium Bundles’ and ‘Supporter Packs’ categories to the in-game Market.\nThe ‘Premium Bundles’ category includes Prime Access and Prime Vault packs. \nFuture community driven in-game Alerts will now be called a “Tenno United Alert” to indicate that they are the result of community efforts! \nThese can be Alerts unlocked from charity events, ARGs, etc. \nClan Recruitment Changes:\nIncreased the ad duration timer from 8 hours to 12 hours.\nAdded the ability to report an applicant’s message if needed.\nAdded the ability for Advertisers to accept or reject requests.\nAdded the ability to sort the Pending Tab of the Clan Menu so that it is easier to see all applicants together.\nFixed an issue where Rank 7 and 8 Clans could not accept requests.\nFixed case where Clan Ads could be posted without consuming the required resources. \nA “Thank You” inbox message will now be sent upon making purchases from the in-game Market. \nUpdated the Oull Requiem Mod icon to an animated icon that displays all possible Requiem Mods.\nThe Oull Requiem Mod was replaced by an animated version to make its functionality more clear.\n\nDisabled Archwing Blink during the detection beams stage in the War Within quest. \nBlink was removing the difficulty and purpose of that mission which requires you to use the cover of the ship to pass through the beams undetected. \nMinor character collision improvements (when colliding with high obstacles). \nReplaced item of significance at the end of the Angels of the Zariman Quest in the Chrysalith. \nPolished some of Gyre’s idle animations. \nUpdated Lephantis’ taunt sounds in the Star Chart. \nMade tweaks to in-game Market dioramas to keep items from clipping through the floors.\nAdjusted the camera in an effort to make items more viewable in the in-game Market. \nDisplay and Articula Orbiter decorations are now chat-linkable!\nMade improvements to the look of cloth collision. \nChat linked Rivens now support showing more than 1024 rerolls. \nUpon throwing a Thermia Canister, you will now switch back to your Primary weapon if that’s what you were using upon pick-up. \nThis applies to the Mastery Rank 28 test as well as the Profit-Taker Orb fight\nMade improvements to the dialogue animations of Relay NPC’s.\nMade improvements to the appearance of the Voidshell Helmet.\nAdded more blinks and more active eye tracking to Cavalero’s idle animations.\nUpdated the textures of all Chrysalith NPC’s.\nMade slight adjustments to Motion Blur FX.\nMade improvements to the tintmask of the Chrysalith NPC’s.\nMade slight improvements to the look of all foliage in all open world zones.\nUpdated the appearance of Hombasks’ neck and hands.\nUpdated the muzzle flash position on the Komorex. \nUpdated the Kavat and Kubrow Market preview dioramas. \nAdded more animations to VERD-IE. \nUpdated the material shaders on Rocks. \nImproved pet behavior when loading into the Dormizone via elevator from Chrysalith, and while roaming around.\nUpdated lighting in the post-New War Orb Vallis. \nUpdated the FX on Oberon's Hallowed Reckoning to be more visible. \nMade minor adjustments to Cephalon Suda’s appearance at the end of Octavia’s Anthem Quest. \nChanged all category names in the Inventory to be plural (Warframes, Prime Parts, etc.). \nMade some slight updates to the Rifle idle animations. \nSlightly increased the Shield recharge delay on most Corpus and Narmer enemy types. \nCleaned up some generic explosion FX used throughout the game. \nImproved the spawning of Corpus Units in the Orb Vallis areas that had issues, such as the Temple of Profit. \nSlightly increased the Sound FX volume of the Sirocco amp.\n",
  "fixes": "\nWe encourage you to continue to use the spoiler-safe Angels of the Zariman sub-forum to discuss lore heavy topics.\n\nThe following weapons, Arcanes, and special items have been added to Cavalero’s Offerings in the Chrysalith!\nCavalero has dug up two new Incarnon weapons previously used for ceremonial purposes.\n\n\nThe Felarx invokes ancient times when aristocrats hunted game. For ceremonies, Orokin elites bred creatures reminiscent of game birds of old to reanimate cultural myths. The Orokin gave the Zariman crew Felarx and a brace of birds as a sign of acceptance into elite society. The brace of birds becomes a pair of powerful pistols at the hands of the Void.\n\n\nIn the early Orokin Empire, elites wore Innodem as a symbolic reminder to defend the defenseless. The tradition fell out of style, but nostalgic elites acknowledged the sentiment in the form of a gift. The Void amplifies that ideal. Void energy strengthens Innodem gliding aerial attacks and the wielder is increasingly resilient as they perform finisher attacks in Incarnon Form.\nFixed Dormizone Vista Suite lighting issues.

In other words, Steel Path matchmaking from the Chrysalith will only match you with other Tenno who are looking for a Steel Path squad from the Chrysalith (same with Steel Path matchmaking from Orbiter Navigation). \nFixed a rare case of being unable to progress in Void Flood missions after killing a Thrax enemy with Void Sling, causing the Thrax to go into an invincible state. \nFixed Zariman Exterminate mission sometimes spawning all the enemies while players are at the beginning of the level. Players now need to progress through the level as normal. \nMore fixes towards a crash when Client returns to the Chrysalith when awakening/spawning a Void Manifestation. \nFixed script error related to Void Ruptures in Void Flood missions. \nFixed an unusable context action appearing on the Exolizers in Void Cascade missions. \nFixed broken enemy behavior when Thrax enemies are disarmed by abilities, which also led them to run around with just a Sheev (fear the butter knife).  \nThey will now take damage (and be knocked down if Overguard is depleted) when disarmed.\nAdded new custom sound FX to activating Focus Schools in the Focus UI. \nAdded a custom TennoGen watermark to background when viewing TennoGen items in the in-game Market.\n",

  "changes": "Angels Of The Zariman: Hotfix 31.5.6:\nExtraction is no longer forced after completing all Bounty objectives in Void Flood missions, the mission can continue indefinitely if players decide to stay. \nImproved the spawning consistency of large Vitoplast orbs in relation to their distance from Void Ruptures. \nUpdated Armaments UI to use seconds instead of percentage in Void Armageddon missions. \nAdded more tutorial messages in the Angels of the Zariman quest Void Flood mission in regards to the Corruption level:\n“Closing ruptures lowers the corruption meter.” \n“Keep the corruption meter low to avoid negative void complications.” \nFixed infinite loading screen when entering the Zariman elevator as Operator during Zariman Bounty. \nThis resulted in having to abort the mission in order to escape the confines of the Elevator. \nFixed Void Flood missions missing UI pop ups to indicate a reward has been given. \nFixed Void Manifestation HUD not showing to players who join a fight in progress. \nFixed the ‘Minimize Void Contamination’ Bounty for Cascade (Use 4 Exolizers while keeping the corruption bar from going above 50%) failing instantly upon mission start on older PCs.\nAdded a scaling spawn cap to Eximus units in Endless mission types (this includes Survival, Void Flood, Void Armageddon, Void Cascade, Disruption, Zealoid Prelate, The Deadlock Protocol quest, and Rising Tide quest).\nPreviously, spawn scaling was uncapped. Now it scales by squad size to take into account solo players vs. squads. In other words, Eximus have the same % to spawn for each enemy, but once you hit the simultaneous Eximus cap no more will spawn until they are killed. Here is the breakdown for scaling spawn cap based on squad #s: \nSolo player = No more than 2 Eximus at a time (this is consistent with non-endless mission caps)\n2 player squad = 2 Eximus max at a time \n3 player squad = 3 Eximus max at a time\n4 player squad = 4 Eximus max at a time\n \nChanged the final Angels of the Zariman quest objective description.\nMade several systemic optimizations to memory usage to save over 2MB of RAM.\nMade several insignificant optimizations to frame-rate.\n",

Its core design encourages the use of your parkour skills as the primary way to collect scattered Vitoplast around the tileset, with enemy drops being secondary. \nFixed Cascadia Overcharge’s Critical Chance buff applying to all weapons instead of just the Secondary, as intended. \nFixed a noticeable seam in the torso/arm area of the Valkyr Carnivex Skin. \nFixed the Vasero Sehkara badges shifting position in an asymmetric way when equipped with shoulder armor. \nFixed some duplicated Blitz/Volatile Eximus effects on Clients.\nFixed being able to sell Aeolak components for Ducats. \nFixed Zariman ghosts standing still indefinitely after Host migration. \nFixed Operator missing facial customizations in the first cinematic of the Angels of the Zariman quest. \nFixed anti-Warframe bubble not working on Clients in Void Cascade missions. \nFixed the key binding screen tabs in Options overlapping with the top key to bind when resolution is set to 1920x1200 and the game is in windowed mode. \nFixed certain mentions of the ‘Void’ not being capitalized. \nFixed an issue with the reload sound FX for the Oscira skin.\nFixing Wisp and Titania’s animation sets not floating while having the Hespar equipped. \nFixed [PH] tags in the Customize HUD Color settings. \nFixed crash when opening up the ‘Hire Railjack Crew Members’ window at Ticker in Fortuna. \nFixed script error related to special Incarnon weapon reticle. \nFixed script error while killing a Hound right before Host migration. \nFixed script error related to the Conclave team select interface. \nFixed script error related to Volt’s Shock ability.\nAdded Focus node Modifiers to the Ability screen descriptions.\n\n",

  "changes": "Angels Of The Zariman: Hotfix 31.5.2:\nIt’s the day after Update 31.5: Angels of the Zariman! We are here with our second hotfix to address some key stability and fixes. Some next-day feedback has been incorporated in this update.\n\nAfter reviewing Community feedback to the Eximus Unit reward changes in Update 31.5.0, we’ve made some further changes, specifically to the Credit drop. The amount of Credits dropped for high level Eximus Units due to the scaling amount changes weren’t hitting the mark for veteran players who play at that level. We don’t want to remove Credits altogether as new players will find these useful in their journey.\nAs a result, Eximus Units now drop 500-750 Credits that no longer scale with level. Non-Steel Path Eximus Units level 30+ now have a chance to drop a Riven Sliver, granted at a smaller chance than their Steel Path counterpart to not diminish their value.\nAs a result of the above changes, Palladino’s Offerings have grown to provide more purchase options for your Riven Slivers, given that you’ll receive more with the above changes.\nAdditional Veiled Riven \n35K Kuva Bundle\n150K Credit bundle\nFor those who appreciated the bigger Credit drop from Eximus Units you can now choose to use your Riven Slivers here.\nPlease note that the per week reset also applies to these Offerings.\nAdditionally, we’ve temporarily removed the “Tax the Taxmen” requirement from the Zariman Bounty rotation due to the prior Eximus Credit drop boon making it possible for a majority of players. We’re looking to change this to a “Kill X Eximus Units” challenge instead in the near future.\nWe have made a gamewide change to how Syndicate Medallions spawn in missions \nthis of course also applies to the latest addition of Voidplumes!\nBefore: Medallions of all tiers spawn completely at random with no logic attached to it.\nNOW: There is now a guarantee that out of the 8 Medallions that spawn in a mission:\n1 will be Rare (aka Voidplume Crest now guaranteed in every mission)! \n2 will be Uncommon\nThe remaining 5 will have a chance to be either Common (75%) or Uncommon (25%).\nThere is now far more benefit to finding all 8 Medallions, as you are guaranteed 3 higher tier out of the total 8.\n\nChanged Void Armageddon “Collect Argozene Crates” Bounty to be 3/5/7/9 instead of 3/5/10/15.\nAdded a tutorial message to the Angels of the Zariman quest during Void Manifestation fight informing that you can Void Sling through Orbs.\nThis tutorial prompt also appears in the fight outside of the quest when assistance is needed. \nAdded a UI Marker to the “inactive” Void Manifestation if you are doing a Zariman Bounty that requires you to defeat them. \nTurning in Zarium Accolades to Melica Caches will now immediately drop the Void Quill instead of after she finishes her voice lines. \nThis also fixes the issue of Cephalon Melica’s voice lines getting interrupted when interacting with her. \nTurned up the volume of the Zarium Accolades. \nAdded sound FX variations to Gyre’s Arcsphere and Coil Horizon cast. \nUpdated a couple animations of the Angels of the Zariman characters in the quest. \nChanged the ‘Zariman Classroom Scene’ Captura scene to ‘Zariman Schoolyard Scene’ to more accurately reflect it.  \nImproved the reload animations of the Laetum.\nAlso fixes the Laetum clipping through Warfarme when not aiming down sight. \nAdded safeguard for when the install drive is removed (or failing) while the game is running.\n\n",

  "changes": "Echoes Of War: Banshee & Mirage Prime Vault: Hotfix 31.1.7:\nAdded ability to preview the Lunar Renewal Theme and Background.\nThis was player feedback since the Market bundles do not show the theme/background in full. Now you can go to Options > Interface > Customize UI Theme > Select Lunar Renewal Theme/Background to preview before purchasing the bundle. \nSet maximum purchase quantity in the in-game Market to 9,999,999. \nYou will only ever see this limit if you have the requirements to purchase whatever you are buying 10 million times. You big spender you.\nMade systemic micro-optimization to load times and improved frame-rate while streaming on Xbox or on PC when using DirectX12.\nContinued to add diagnostics to try to isolate random DirectX 12 crashes.\n",

The coupon discount will now appear on hover. If you were affected by this issue please create a ticket at support.warframe.com\nFixed the Sniper Ammo Mutation mod not mutating Rifle ammo at the described rate. \nFor example, at Rank 0 you should receive 1 Sniper ammo per Rifle pickup and it was giving 0. \nFixed the following issues with the Protovyre Armor Set: \nFixed completing the Protovyre Sentient killing challenge not awarding players with the evolved Protovyre Chest piece. \nThis was caused by exiting Railjack from the menu, which would fail to deliver Protovyre inbox message if challenge was completed.\nFor those affected, we will be running a script that will deliver the inbox message with the evolved Protovyre Chest piece. We will update this thread once we have started and finished the script.   Edit: The script has been run! \nFixed Requiem Relics dropped from Thralls or Hounds not counting towards the Protovyre Syandana challenge progression.\nFixed Sister of Pavos Hounds becoming permanent allies (and blocking progression) if affected by abilities like Nyx’s Mind Control or Revenant’s Enthrall. \nFixed Amp appearing in town hubs on a post-New War character. \nFixed clipping issues with the Nidus Kuvael Scrounger helmet open/closed states.\nFixed Nidus Kuvael Scrounger helmet’s fleshy meat pieces not hiding properly in its closed non-mutated state. \nFixed turrets not taking damage from bullets in Wyrmius, as reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1229467-wyrmius-cant-kill-the-turret/\nFixed Wyrmius turret projectiles firing from the wrong position.\nFixed more icons appearing stretched after the great icon “squarification” treatment:\nVallis Beast and Bird Emblem \nFixed incorrect lighting in some cases when ‘Shadow Quality’ is set to ‘Low’.\nFixed ‘CORRUPTED’ prefix appearing in all caps in corrupted enemies name UI.  \nFixed possible map hole near power structures in the Corpus Gas City tileset. \nFixed some punctuation issues in the Lotus’ transmission and Vox Solaris quest. \nFixed the Vitrica’s sound FX building up when turning many enemies to glass at the same time.\n",

  "changes": "Update 31.1.0: Echoes Of War:\n\nThe year is 2022, and Digital Extremes is back with the first Mainline of the year \nwe’ve got roughly 4GB of content changes!\nLess than 2 months ago The New War Quest was launched on all platforms. Our ambitions to have Replay on launch didn’t make it in time, but we made it our top priority to have it ready for our first Update of 2022. There’s still no accurate words to describe our appreciation for all the support and reactions to The New War, and we hope you enjoy replaying it as many times as you wish!\nThere’s lots more in the Warframe oven for 2022 \nthank you for coming along the ride!\n\nIn addition, you may notice nods to the Public Test Cluster in some sections. Thank you to everybody that participated in our weekend test! We’ve made some changes in response that you’ll find throughout the patch notes.\n\n\nExperience The New War Quest once more, Tenno! Access The New War Quest in the Codex to Replay. Please note with this implementation the Replay is a full time commitment and you will be locked into the Quest as you were in the first run, so plan accordingly.\n\nThis quest has significant Spoilers for Warframe and its future. While The New War has been out since December 15th, there are still Tenno out there who have yet to experience it for the first time. Please let all Tenno experience it at their own pace, and be kind. Use liberal spoiler tags if you wish to talk about it, and do not ruin the experience for someone else. Content Creators should clearly label spoiler content and use spoiler-free thumbnails.\n\nThe Quest can be discussed in our temporary Sub Forum: https://forums.warframe.com/forum/1782-the-new-war/\nReveal hidden contents\nDuring the “end choice” moment, you’ll be able to select the other choices for strictly experience purposes. The choice you made in your original playthrough will override it each time once complete.\n\n\nAdditionally, 3 ‘The New War’ Somachord Tones have been added to the post-New War Plains of Eidolon and Orb Vallis. Based on player feedback, we have made these Somachord Tones stationary, meaning they will always be in the same spot (different from the original Orb Vallis Somachord Tones) and require 1 scan each. They’ll remain in their spots after Scanned for helpful Tenno who waypoint them for others!\n\nKeep a look out for the following Somachord Tones:\nFor Narmer\nHybrid Abominations\nSunkiller\n\n\nIncluded in this first batch of designs from Round 21, you’ll find exciting Skins and Customizations for your Warframes, Weapons, and more! Check them out now via Steam launcher and support hard-working Tenno designers from the Warframe Community.\n\nHarrow Algalyst Skin by Goosmo\nWisp Sycorax Skin by Vulbjorn, the graphical walrus.\nWisp Celestist Skin by malaya & Awk’Q-Luz\nTitania Pixialyst Skin by kakarrot2812\n\nFei Syandana by malaya & Jadie\nLaprosys Syandana by FrellingHazmot\nDraugen Syandana by Goosmo\nEklis Syandana by Goosmo\n\nAvyrdi Shoulder Armor by led2012 & lex182\n\nKsara Two-Handed Nikana Skin by kakarrot2812\n\n\n\n\nDescend from on high as the legend that Hildryn truly is.

This Adversary Weapon Generation Quality of Life change is meant to reduce randomness over time of what weapon a Progenitor Candidate (Sister) or Larvling (Kuva Lich) can spawn with.\n\nThe list of rejected weapons is cleared once you accept an Adversary and the process would start again from a clean slate for both Sister or Kuva Lich the next time you go looking for an Adversary. This list clearing applies to both Sister and Kuva Lich, meaning once the chosen Adversary is Converted or Vanquished, the list clears for both factions.\n\n\nBegins at 2pm ET today!\n\nIt’s Star Days, Stardust!

Due to factors including The New War’s December launch, we have opted to merge this year’s TennoBaum & Star Days together in the month of February.\nFestive accessories from TennoBaum 2020 will return as part of Ticker’s Star Days offerings, and the TennoBaum tradition of donating will continue with a donation to a charity (to be announced on February 9) on behalf of the Warframe community. While no in-game gifting event and online tracker will occur this year, we’ll also be taking the spirit of gift-giving into a special TennoBaum x Star Days livestream on February 10th, which will be our Prime Time gifting spectacular!\n*As shown on Devstream #159, we have Lunar New Year celebrations coming soon! Stay tuned!\n\nWe rebuilt reflections across the entire game when Enhanced Graphics Engine is enabled to use modern high quality texture format which improves the quality and punch of gold, bronze, chrome, and other metallics. This change reduces the noise, makes them more vibrant, and ultimately more balanced overall. A lot to visually enjoy during your replay (or first playthrough!) of The New War!\n\nHold onto your seats: we’ve converted all Arsenal Screen rectangle icons to squares. This applies to places like the Arsenal, Operator, and Codex which previously used rectangular icons.\nTo provide some Dev insight: At the moment, we have literally thousands of duplicated icons. Each item had to support both displaying as a rectangle and as a square, but now that everything has been converted to squares, all the rectangle icons are soon to be deleted. Which will reduce the game file size once we hit the big delete button \nstay tuned on that! In the meantime, if you see anything funky with icons (squished/stretched/cropped etc) please let us know.\nThe Options menu has been reworked to bring some new and reorganize the old! This is the beginning of our broader Options menu rework efforts that will continue in a near future Update, stay tuned!\n\nNEW: Accessibility options now have their own tab! You’ll find respective VIDEO and INTERFACE accessibility options now live here.\nGAMEPLAY has been renamed to SYSTEM, and CHAT has been renamed to SOCIAL.\nMoved all networking related options to System under a Network header\nMoved all friend/gift/party request options to Social under a Privacy header\nMoved all chat channel options to Social under a Chat header\nMoved all chat appearance options to Social under a Chat Appearance header\nDISPLAY has been renamed to VIDEO.\nAdded 3 new headers: Display, Graphics, and Advanced. Respective options have been moved within the headers.\n Added 3 new headers to the AUDIO tab: Sound, Sound Mixer, and Voice. Respective options have been moved within the headers.\nAdded 1 new header to the INTERFACE tab: User Interface (alongside HUD). Respective options have been moved within the headers.\nMoved \"Item Labels\" into the \"Customize UI Theme\" screen.\n\nIn addition to the already existing Conservation method of Trail & Tranq, all species of animal on Orb Vallis can now be found ambiently in the wild! (Bolarola, Sawgaw, Kubrodon, Horrasque, Stover, Pobber, Vermink). Due to the endangered nature of the species, the rarest subspecies will still need to be tracked down by following their trails.\n\nNew Sky/Atmospheric technology brings a physically-plausible simulation based on time of day. Enhancing the atmospheric experience to feel more immersive and accurate when a time of day is represented. \nImproved visuals within the Cambion Drift landscape by comprehensive efforts to have less competing emissive values on foliage. This can be attributed to reduced spore particles and reduction in the overall red color the\nEnemy reinforcements will now spawn more frequently during the Drone Hijack mission in the Plains of Eidolon Bounty to reduce down-time and increase density of enemies to defend from while running alongside the Drone. \nSimple reasoning here is to bring a bit more intensity to this Bounty to have your escorting efforts feel valued. \nEnemy reinforcements will now spawn more frequently in Exterminate and Assassinate missions in Plains of Eidolon Bounties.\nAdditionally, reinforcements that spawn in caves will now be more inclined to chase the player, instead of just patrolling idly without a care in the world. \nUnified the drop rate of each house’s MK II and MK III weapons dropped from Corpus Crewships in Pluto Proxima and Corpus Veil Proxima regions to Uncommon (12.50%). \nPreviously the Talyn and Vort MK III were Legendary drops with a 0.65% chance, while the others were Uncommon at a 24.35% drop chance. Vort and Talyn MK II were Rare with a 5.64% chance, while the others were Uncommon with 19.36%. Instead of having certain weapons in the same tier level weighing more than others in terms of rarity, there is now a far more equal drop chance across each weapon. \nRailjack Crew Kuva Liches and Sisters of Parvos can now Revive players and Crew!\nLavos’ Vial Rush has been slightly changed in the name of performance. When casting Vial Rush zones from previous Vial Rush are removed but deal a one time damage proportional to their remaining duration.\nYou can now replace an existing Arrival Gate with another Gate located elsewhere in your Dojo should you choose to. Previously you had to destroy the original Arrival Gate in order to place a new one.\nAmped up Nechramech summon FX and added summon animations. \nImproved Bow animation movement to better match sprint turn speed. \nMade some lighting updates to the Grineer Sealab tileset. \nUpdated the Orbiter Arsenal floor to make collision more accurate.\nImproved frequency of rare tiles that almost never appear in some Grineer Shipyard tileset mission types.\nSoftened the look of hair/fur while using the Enhanced Graphics Engine option (Temporal AA remains unchanged). Refined look to the shading. \nAdjusted the Ogris and Kuva Ogris Nightwatch Napalm FX to be cleaner and use energy color consistently. \nAdded Zarr alt-fire FX. \nImproved the colors in the waterfall FX in the Grineer Forest tileset. \nChanged Oberon's Passive description from ‘buff’ to ‘link’ since allied companions stats are calculated based on Oberon’s. \nMade improvements and fixes to out-of-bounds & AI pathing in the Grineer Shipyards tileset. \nIncreased the variety and randomization of the Cambion Drift underground tunnels to give the space a more lively feel. \nThe Amalgam Furax Body Count Mod now applies a Blast proc and Stagger on Melee kills.\nThe original Mod description stated that “Melee kills knockdown enemies within 15m” but that functionality has been missing in-mission since Blast Status was changed in Update 27.2 to no longer knockdown enemies . In addition to the Blast Status, we have also added the stagger to restore its original function pre-Status overhaul. We have also updated the description to be more accurate to the Mod’s function. \nAdded locations for Gems, Ores, and their derived types to their descriptions.\nEnemies will no longer throw grenades at adjacent walls when trying to hit an out-of-sight target. \nToned down the brightness of Revenant’s Mesmer Skin FX. It will also now be hidden while in Archwing.\nRemoved Parazon Finisher prompt on flying enemies, since they have to be grounded to become eligible for said Finisher. \nAdded animations when performing Parazon Finishers on Crawlers. \nConverted the following weapons when used by enemies to PBR:\nGlaxion\nJat Kittag\nVulkar \nSupra\n Improved how Pobbers and Kuakas handle sloped terrain. \nGas City door scanners are now more lenient and their trigger has been narrowed.\nUsing the Arsenal will now mute background dialog from NPCs and Pets.\n\n",
  "fixes": "Scaled down the Captura controls list to cover less screen space. \nFixed not being able to fine-tune the exposure setting in the Plains of Eidolon Captura Scene.\nFixed your Warframe’s orientation quickly changing whenever the Captura Lighting Colour settings are changed.\nFixed some text overlap in longer languages in Captura screens.\n\nThanks to everyone who participated in our Public Test Weekend for New War replay functionality (and possibly first-time Quest runs)! Over 200 testers shared their reports spanning the entire New War quest. We’ve done our best to focus on the larger issues, and those that affected replay functionality, in time for this mainline release. We have you to thank for the following issues being resolved:\nFixed misaligned Railjack when entering from Archwing during The New War Quest.\nFixed your Companion appearing in a cutscene in The New War Quest. \nFixed holding a light incorrectly during certain parts of The New War Quest.\nFixed being in your default customizations in certain moments during the final mission of The New War Quest.\nFixed a group of Brachiolysts missing some of their Health in the first mission of The New War Quest. \nFixed an infinite loading screen during a pivotal transition moment during The New War Quest.\nFixed a certain character’s Orvius toss being titled ‘Rip Line’. It is now titled ‘Orvius Reach’.\n\nWe still have a number of reports that are being investigated, so expect more improvements to trickle in during future Hotfixes!\n\nFixed receiving all the Protovyre Armor evolved forms (Emergent and Apex) if you only purchased one of the Protovyre Armor parts. Full PSA here.\nThe Protovyre correction script has been run! The following has been implemented: \nPlayers who have evolved Protovyre parts in their account but did not purchase the base version of the part, have had the evolved versions removed. \nChallenge progress related to unlocking the evolving armor has not been affected.\nFixed Galvanized Mod \"bonus Damage per Status\" not functioning for numerous projectile weapons.\nA previous change had them operate relative to \"base damage\" but the code was incorrectly getting base damage from the impact behavior rather than the projectile. This problem was pervasive and there are hundreds of weapons in our game!

This Syandana is Exclusive to Revenant just as other Deluxe Skins attachments are exclusive to them. Please note that the “energy beard” on the original Revenant Helmet gets removed when the Mephisto Syandana is equipped due to excessive clipping.

While many Tenno have hoped for more Stat buffs (which we have here!), the Utility Buffs are really something to behold for the usability or Merulina. We are introducing a foundational change to her movement: Merulina Dashing (tap Roll/Dash)! This can be executed in any direction and is effectively a new way to close gaps (or quickly retreat!) and alter the direction of Yareli aboard Merulina! This also enhances the way you can traverse vertically with responsive directional input while in the air. We’ve made a handy .gif to demonstrate just what we mean:\nBehold in .gif form:https://gfycat.com/impeccablenecessaryblacknorwegianelkhound\n\nWhat you see in this .gif is a vertical traversal that’s currently tough to do with Yareli. However,  with the forward dash the momentum movement now allows for directional maneuvering.\nThen, we see Yareli Dash both Forward AND Back in the .gif, showing how you can certainly take advantage of this new movement tool!\n\nThis is a change that’s best experienced in your hands, but it is certainly a huge improvement for navigating all of Warframes tilesets!\n\nIncrease seek speed by about 60% and slightly increase bubble visibility to better register your casts.\n\nIncrease range by just about 25%\nIncrease damage and duration by 50%\n\nBigger is better. The bigger we Rip, the more enemies, the better scaling, and so on!\nIncrease radius by 25%\n\nIn the final Railjack Showdown node for a Sister of Parvos, each Sister will give each squad member 1 Corrupted Holokey at End-of-Mission whether you Vanquish or Convert them! This means a Squad of 4 can leave with 4 Corrupted Holokeys each on Showdown mission complete! \nCorrupted Holokey drop amounts have been increased in Void Storms! Void Storms in the Veil Proxima will now drop 10 (vs 6) to make the hardest content the most rewarding. The rest have all had their amounts increased by 1.\n\nReduced the time between Grineer Kuva Thrall spawns, so that the time to get all 10 to spawn is more in line with the time it takes to get all 3 Corpus Hounds to spawn.\nMade improvements to the Kuva Lich/Sister showdown cinematic:\nAdded music befitting a showdown! \nFixed the cinematic being silent.\nFixed ability to manipulate the camera during the cinematic.\nFixed animation popping during the cinematic.\nChanged Sister Candidate waypoint icon to be the Sister icon instead of the Treasurer (Granum Crown) icon.\nFixed a progression stopper in the Sister showdown fight due to the Sister’s Hound not spawning if the Host player died and went AFK after entering the Capital Ship.\nFixed an issue where a Kuva Lich with the ‘Ensnare’ ability could potentially prevent the context action for execution from appearing if the ability was cast prior to being weakened.\nFixed not receiving the Sisterhood Sigil after Converting or the Sisterhood Emblem after Vanquishing a Sister of Parvos.\nUpon login those missing their respective Sisterhood Sigil/Emblem will receive them.\nFixed Rhino’s Rhino Stomp perpetually stunning both Kuva Liches and Sisters of Parvos.\nFixed the Kuva Lich and Sister Vanquish animation not playing correctly, where it would turn the Lich/Sister invisible or fall through the floor during the animation.\nFixed missing Client Parazon Mercy animations on Grineer Thralls.\nFixed issue where fusing two partially ranked Kuva or Tenet weapons together appeared to increase the rank of your weapon. \nThis was a UI / display only, as the Valence fusion does not increase a weapon rank. Now, the weapon rank does not increase from fusion and the UI does not incorrectly show that it has. \nFixed an issue in Crew Command where Liches would appear as Grineer Heavy Gunners in the Railjack UI. It now shows the Kuva Lich or Sisters of Parvos badge icons where it previously showed Grineer Heavy Gunners to represent this Crew member. \nFixed unlocalized Kuva Lich Inbox messages.\nFixed Kuva Lich names appearing as part of the Ephemera name in Kuva Lich Inbox messages.\n\nFor a long time now we’ve had a precedent with a handful of Warframe Skins where the “None” option for Attachments (and sometimes Syandanas) was removed if certain Skins, Primes, etc were equipped. This applied to Warframes such as Ember Prime/Pyraxis Skin, Frost, Mag Prime, Oberon, Volt, etc.\n\nWe now usher in a new “None” era! All Warframes and Warframe Skins that previously did not have the ‘None’ option will have a “None” Attachment or Syandana option, giving you even MORE customization flexibility. This means you can remove details such as any attachments on Ember Pyraxis, Mag Prime, the list goes on and on! In addition, Banshee, Frost and Oberon's default Shoulder Armor can now be equipped on Prime versions of the Warframe.\n\nThis also fixes a long-standing bug where a Warframe that has no default Shoulders Attachments (let's say, Excalibur) and had nothing equipped there, if you clicked on \"left arm\" then it would auto-select the first shoulder armor in your owned list.\n\nHemocyte is now immune to looting abilities that often didn’t fully work due to how quickly the body despawns (Hydroid's Tentacle Swarm with Pilfering Swarm, Nekros' Desecrate etc).\nWith the re-run of Plague Star, we are adding Nidus Prime’s Relics as in-world drops from the Hemocyte. This change was brought forth with this in mind, and the acquisition rate of this new Prime that could be influenced with loot abilities which is not a precedent we wish to set. With up to 4 Hemocytes that can spawn in the final stage it felt especially important to make this change. \nAmbassador Component Blueprints have a chance to drop from Aurax Atloc Raknoids. The main Blueprint can now be attained as a Rotation C reward from any Corpus Railjack Survival mission.\nAfter engaging with Community Feedback, we noticed that obtaining the Ambassador parts was a tough combination of playing the same mission in 4 different locations with some difficult RNG. The Ambassador components have also been moved to an enemy that was without a drop table!\nEvery Aurax Atloc Raknoid has a 15% to drop any component Blueprints for the Ambassador \nEnemies typically only drop Weapon Blueprints or component Blueprints which is why the Ambassador components were given individual Blueprints \nTweaked Zephyr’s Airburst pull vacuum to lift enemies up a bit off the ground so they aren't dragging their butts. Plus updated the FX to go along with it! \nZephyr’s Airburst was intended to pull enemies in like Vortex for a short duration, but was spawning exactly where the projectile hit, resulting in being inside the floor. We fixed it by making the vortex spawn a bit above the floor and in the process gave it an FX pass to communicate better what was happening.\nAdded ‘Missing Requirements’ context information to Ergo Glast’s shop in the Relays. \nMade the following changes to the Saxum Mod set:\nThe cooldown will now appear in the HUD.\nRemoved fall-off damage and increased the range to 4/8/12 metres. \nIncreased the knockback to enemies caught closer to the impact while heavily staggering enemies within range but further away from the explosion.\nAlso fixed issues with the Saxum mod set bonus not matching the in-game description: Lifted enemies explode on death and deal up to 30% of their max health as Impact damage.\nReduced Riven challenge condition for \"Kill X enemies with headshots from at least 100m away\" to 75m away. \nChanged the sorting of items on the End Of Mission screen to better reflect importance, including Steel Essence, Riven Slivers, Granum Crowns, Built Forma, Orokin Cells, Corrupted Holokeys, built Prime parts, War Hilt, Requiem Ultimatums, Exilus Adapters, Drop Chance Boosters, Scintillant, and built Railjack Components.\nHarrow Neuroptic Blueprints can now be obtained from the first vault in Pago, and as a Rotation C reward from Taveuni on the Kuva Fortress. Mod and Relic rewards have been swapped on Pago, and drop rates increased slightly. \nHarrow Systems Blueprints drop rates on Defection missions have been increased slightly, and added as a Rotation C reward from Taveuni on the Kuva Fortress.\nIn response to community feedback on farming for Harrow, we revisited the process for obtaining his components. We are making it easier to obtain Harrow Neuroptic Blueprints, and Harrow Systems Blueprints, from the locations outlined above.\nRemoved Intensify from the mid-tier Defection rewards.\nWe found that Intensify was an unnecessary addition to Defection rewards, and therefore skewed the chances of receiving other rewards, hence it’s removal.\nOctavia’s Mandachord option has been moved into the top Arsenal menu, under the Parazon option.\nThe Mandachord is a very important piece of equipment for Octavia’s abilities \nhaving it buried and not as readily accessible was not ideal considering that it is key to her performance. It is now much easier to find it and create a tune of destruction! \nAdded scrollbar to Index result screen. \nSyndicate Medallion trade in screens have been given the UI theme treatment.\nAdded ‘Insufficient Funds’ context information to the Syndicate offerings ‘Confirm Purchase’ panel.\nImproved NPC zipline usage in the Gas City tileset. Their parkour skills were just a bit too weak.  \nA warning for unowned Landing Craft Skins will now appear when attempting to purchase a skin for a Landing Craft type they do not own. \nIncreased visibility of control panels for extendable-bridges in some major corridors in the Corpus Gas City tileset.\nWe’ve changed the underlying code of our UI for future proofing, but you shouldn't notice anything just yet. If you come across anything janky please let us know!\nAdjusted Chroma Elemental Ward stat display to be more accurate (uses % display for Health/Shield/Armor/reload/holster buffs).\nImproved the tent textures in the Plains of Eidolon. \nAdjusted the Brachiolyst ragdoll animation to make it more natural looking. \nUpdated Foundry preview images for Scorched Beacon and Chroma Mark Blueprints (for The New Strange Quest), which were appearing as low resolution images. \nChanged the timing of the Sentient’s damage pulse & weapon reattach to occur at a specific time within the animation rather than at the end.\nPreviously, destroying both arms on Sentients would cause them to drop weapons. Sentients no longer drop anything when arms are destroyed but will instead regenerate them. This regeneration causes a damage pulse that has been modified to occur during the animation rather than at the end.\nReduced the damage and overall range of the Ortholyst Sentient’s long ranged barrage cluster projectiles. \nRevenant's Danse Macabre ability now deals finisher damage against inanimate objects instead of adopting a damage type based on the target. It still does adaptive damage and applies adaptive status effects against enemies.\nPrior to this change, Danse Macabre was allowing Revenant to solve Operator-required puzzles, which is clearly not intended. \nRemoved the ability to collect duplicate Ephemeras. \nEphemeras now abide by the “one per person” rule that other cosmetic items follow. And thus clearing out the unnecessary inventory clutter.\nA script will run upon first login after updating to remove existing duplicates. \nUpdated to K-Drive and Merulina riding so that the rider's aim end point matches the vehicle’s aim end point. This addresses cases of moving in unintended directions.\nUpdated the Dojo room HUD title to have more of a Vitruvian theme!\nUpdated the Menu UI in the Personal Quarters to reflect a Vitruvian theme! Fish Tank, Articula, etc!\nAdded Orokin Ciphers and Omega Isotopes as a feeding option to the Helminth, which will grant Bile.\nAdded Cryptographic ALU as a feeding option to the Helminth, which will grant Synthetics.\nThe ‘Converted Adversaries’ menu will now auto open when starting a Trade in the Crimson Branch instead of having to click through the tabs.\nUpon login, those that received the unintended Shotgun Riven Mod for Kitguns via GOTL Alert will have their Riven corrected to a proper Pistol Kitgun Riven Mod. \nPlease note that this does not change the Challenge or any Cycling you have already done.\nReworded the Viral Quills description to decrease it’s unnecessary length. \nReworded the ‘Vault Looter’ Nightwave Act to clarify that it’s for the Dragon Key Vaults, not the Isolation Vaults.\nPlayers under Mastery Rank 2 will no longer see the ‘Update History’ messages upon login, as this information may be overwhelming as they begin their Warframe journey.\nTweaked the compression of Cursors so they look better at mid-sizes, although this unfortunately makes them not as sharp when scaled to max. Trying to find a happy middle ground!\nMade a few changes to the Helminth 15th Metamorphosis “Golden Instinct” Void Spark:\nDoubled the Void Sparks lifespan\nIncreased the Void Sparks visibility\nIncreased start time of Golden Instinct\n\nMade systemic micro-optimizations to engine and level loading.\nOptimized out some hitches when using DirectX 12. \nMade micro-optimizations to DirectX 12 memory footprint.\nMade micro-optimizations to game startup when running DirectX 12.\nOptimized out many small hitches when using DirectX 12. \nFixed a bug that would cause certain shadows to malfunction in DirectX 12 on PC.\nMade systemic micro-optimizations to DirectX 11 rendering.\nMade a micro-optimization to level loading and streaming.\nMade a micro-optimization to UI rendering.\nMade a micro-optimization to Depth of Field rendering.\nMade micro-optimizations to the fog rendering.\nMade some systemic micro-optimizations to memory footprint.\nMade systemic micro-optimizations to shadow rendering on all platforms.\nMade some micro-optimizations to particle-system rendering. \nMade micro-optimizations to rendering on all platforms. \nMade systemic micro-optimizations for all platforms.\nFixed an inconsequential graphical inconsistency that may have caused a few micro-stutters on DirectX 12.\n\n",

  "changes": "Update 30.5: Sisters Of Parvos:\n\n\nThe Kuva Lich system, originally introduced in the Old Blood update on Halloween of 2019, has expanded to introduce a new faction! The Sisters of Parvos update will bring your own personal Corpus adversary to the Origin System. Those acquainted with the Kuva Lich system will find familiarity with the Sisters of Parvos, but with a full Corpus experience!\nA new cinematic awaits those who have finished The Call of The Tempestarii and The War Within…\n\nCompleted the Call of the Tempesterii Quest\nFirst, one must not have an active Kuva Lich, meaning a Kuva Lich and Sister cannot actively be hunting you at the same time \nit’s one or the other! Once you are free from the grips of your Kuva Lich (the process is faster now, see below) it’s time to enter The Granum Void!\nOnce back in your Orbiter, the Sisters name is revealed and takes over the pre-existing Kuva Lich screen to display all her attributes, abilities, AND her trusty Hound. New to the Lich system these Hounds serve as the Sisters personal assassin, tasked with making your life difficult within the Sisters influenced Sector.\nYour Sister then begins her reign over the Star Chat by influencing nodes as her own, but she won’t let you walk into her Sector easily. To help with matchmaking, we have made influence nodes consistent across all Lich and Sister levels. Venus is where Sisters of Parvos start at Rank 1! Once in an influenced node, the Sister’s Hound is released! While these Hounds pose a much harder battle than Kuva Lich Thralls, the Murmur progress is significantly greater. In addition, Hound Mercy Kills can award you Requiem Relics! As a typical Corpus, your Sister will steal any earned Credits from the mission.\nAs you continue fighting the Sister’s Hound on influenced nodes the chance of having your Sister spawn in the mission increases. The process of testing the Requiem order on your Sister is similar to Kuva Liches as failure levels her up, but instead of providing Kuva you and your squadmates can earn between 5K-10K Credits per Requiem attempt.\nOnce you’ve performed the correct sequence of Requiem Mods on your Sister, she will flee to a final, guaranteed showdown in her Capital Ship within Railjack in the Neptune Proxima (minimum Pilot Intrinsic 5)! Take her on when you’re ready. Other Tenno looking to fight their own Sister of Parvos will matchmake to the same node, where you can work side-by-side to take down your unique foes one-by-one!\nComplete the Railjack objective to gain access to the Capital Ship. As you traverse through the Capital Ship corridors in search of your Sister you must defeat Warframe Specters tasked with protecting her.\nOnce you’ve Parazoned the Requiem Sequence you have the familiar decision to either Convert or Vanquish your Sister. Converting a Sister earns you back all stolen Credits, allows her to randomly join you in mission as an ally and becomes eligible for a Railjack Crew member (including On-Call)! Vanquishing your Sister earns you back all stolen Credits, the Sister’s signature weapon, and Ephemera (if applicable).\n\n\n\n\nHound Component Blueprints are tradeable. Visit Legs in Fortuna to assemble a Hound Companion with your Components! Here you can also Provide your Hound to Legs for 4K Solaris United Standing. This amount is higher in comparison to MOA Companions due to the acquisition flow required for a Hound.\n*Building a Hound includes a weapon, therefore requiring 2 Companion Slots.\n\nHound Precepts are rewarded based on the Model, Bracket, and Stabilizer chosen at Legs in Fortuna.\n*Precept stats below are at max rank.\nMelee Hound weapons are rewarded after claiming a completed Hound from the Foundry (when you’ve vanquished a Sister of Parvos) or when building a Hound at Legs in Fortuna. The Melee weapon type is dependent on the Hound’s Model.\nErrant Specters in the Granum Void have a chance to drop Spectral Debris. This Resource is used in the Hound Component crafting process.\n\n*Subsumed Helminth Abilities cannot be used while Merulina is active.\n*Aquablades is Yareli’s Helminth Ability!\nPurchase Yareli in the in-game Market or earn the Yareli Blueprint from the Waverider Quest and her parts from the new VENTKIDS' BASH LAB Dojo Room as Clan Tech!\nWF_YareliProfile_VID2_AllPlatforms_ESRB_3840x2160_60fps_H264_July6.mp4Unavailable\n\n\nIf you purchase Yareli with Platinum, you will receive a Riven Mod as a Quest Reward in addition to the Yareli Blueprint and the Yareli Prex Card!\n*For those who accidentally sell the Yareli Blueprint you can find another in Simaris’ Offerings once the Waverider Quest is complete.\n** Yareli being able to switch to and from Operator while aboard Merulina is in progress for a future Hotfix. \n*** Known Issue: Security Cameras cannot detect Yareli while she is on Merulina. This will be fixed.\n\nPurchase the Kompressa in the in-game Market or from Ventkid Offerings for Standing.\nPurchase the Merulina Syandana in the in-game Market!\nPurchase the Yareli Physalia Helmet in the in-game Market or as part of future Nightwave Cred Offering rotations.\n\nPurchase the Yareli Agile & Noble Animations in the in-game Market!\n\nThe youthful sovereign of the sea arises from the waves, attired for battle. Includes Yareli Warframe, Yareli Physalia Helmet, Kompressa Pistol, Merulina Syandana, Waverider’s Heart Decoration, and 3-Day Affinity and Credit Boosters.\nPurchase the Waverider Collection in the in-game Market! If you gift this Collection to a friend, you’ll receive a bonus copy of Waverider’s Heart Decoration!\nBe on the lookout for Kuva Larvlings with the following new weapons:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have changed the way you progress against your Lich by having consistent Influence regions per level of your Lich!.\nThe problem we aim to solve here is scattered matchmaking for players seeking Murmurs overall. Players would often have the same goal but never cross paths due to their Liches separation across the Origin System.\nThe details of this change are:\n1) Rank 1 Kuva Liches appear on Earth\n2) Rank 2 Kuva Liches appear on Mars\n3) Rank 3 Kuva Liches appear on Ceres\n4) Rank 4 Kuva Liches appear on Sedna\n5) Rank 5 Kuva Liches appear on the Kuva Fortress\n*Please note: if you had an Active Lich before the Update, it’ll progress through its current occupation nodes before it adopts the new Region flow.\nThis new Oull Requiem Mod counts as the correct Requiem Sequence for whatever Parazon Requiem slot it is in when taking down a Lich or Sister of Parvos! Like other Requiem Mods, the Oull can be used successfully 3 times.\nEarn this new Requiem as a 25% drop chance when your Kuva Lich or Sister of Parvos flees after you’ve used the correct Requiem Sequence. *This Requiem only drops for the person whose Lich/Sister is downed.\nEarn this Requiem Ultimatum as a 25% drop chance when choosing to either Convert or Vanquish your Kuva Lich or Sister of Parvos. *This Requiem only drops for the person whose Lich/Sister is downed.\nBetween reducing the required Murmurs, adding OULL, adding Requiem Ultimatums, and having this new flow, we have shortened the Kuva Lich cycle and added more control for all Tenno! The final fight is now on your terms, and we hope you enjoy the efforts to improve and simplify this system!\nWe have made Valence Fusion for Weapons more intuitive in this Update! We are inheriting the behaviour we added for Railjack which was much more clear to our players!\nThroughout our boss design history, we have added things like diminishing returns and damage mitigation techniques like armor or damage attenuation. In the time since we’ve launched the Kuva Liches, we’ve made adjustments to how we handle player damage vs. Liches. We’ve done things like add allowing Status Effects and attenuate damage to try and create a balanced combat experience. Like many bosses in Warframe, Liches have some damage modifiers applied to them.\nWe found a bug in the damage attenuation code, and have fixed it and polished the attenuation for Kuva Liches.\nThis system generally targets the scenario of very high damage things like the Void Rig’s Arquebex vs. a Kuva Lich, a scenario that is now possible due to the final showdown being based in Railjack. When we were testing this Voidrig Vs Lichout, our Liches barely lasted a second and we realized the damage attenuation code could use some review! We found bugs to fix and things to tweak to account for these new scenarios. Our only intention is to give you a fight that lasts more than mere seconds \nhappy hunting and may your teamwork and gear lead you to victory! We will be closely reviewing this to ensure we strike the right balance of a fight that requires teamwork and consistent offensive gameplay to beat, but also doesn’t feel impossible. Feedback is welcome!\nUpdated the Lich Tutorial screen to include new Lich flow and Sisters related information.\nChanged the \"Captured Liches\" category to \"Converted Adversaries\" in the Trade window.\nIf you do not have any Kuva Lich or Sisters of Parvos history in your Codex, a pop-up message will appear to tell you that you have not encountered any. \nAdded new Kuva Lich transmissions for the following scenarios:\nLich Defeated Player Taunt\nLich Downed Player\nLich Kills Player\nFixed failing Requiem Mods sequence affecting the appearance of other players’ Kuva Liches.\nFixed holding the Parazon as if it was a sidearm if a Host migration occurred during the Kuva Lich Parazon stab animation.\nFixed instances where Parazon would become invisible or not animating during Kuva Lich attempts. \nFixed getting stuck in other players' Kuva Lich stab cinematics.\nParazon attacks were introduced in The Old Blood as a way to Mercy kill enemies. This stylish and universal blade has had a clear role in all things Liches, but their role in the game at large has been hard to play around. There are problems in need of solving, and the below outlines how we’ve done just that!\nWe are changing their design, adding new Mods (thanks Design Council!), and refreshing the system.\nAll humanoid Eximus\nGrineer\nHeavy Gunners\nBombards\nCorpus\nScrambus\nNullifiers\nInfested\nAncients\n\nAnd the logic is rooted in the following common scenario:\nYou can plan and decide!\nBut what about really high levels you ask?\nWe have made changes to this since our original Developer Workshop.\nUp until level 150, the Parazon Finisher triggers at 40% Health remaining. \nAfter that, every 5 levels reduces the threshold by 1%, down to a minimum of 10%! Eligible Enemy Health bars will have a notch on them to indicate these thresholds..\nThis change was made to make it more clear to our players, as well as still approach guaranteed kills at high levels with an amount of balance.\nEach Proxima Void Storm can reward Corrupted Holokeys as Common mission rewards. These replace the End of Mission Void Trace rewards from Void Storms.\nEARTH VOID STORM\n2x Corrupted Holokey: Common 37.50%\nVENUS VOID STORM\n2x Corrupted Holokey: Common 37.50%\nSATURN VOID STORM\n4x Corrupted Holokey: Common 37.50%\nNEPTUNE VOID STORM\n3x Corrupted Holokey: Common 37.50%\nPLUTO VOID STORM\n5x Corrupted Holokey: Common 37.50%\nVEIL PROXIMA VOID STORM\n6x Corrupted Holokey: Common 37.50%\nVisit Ergo Glast in a Relay and view his new weekly Merchandise.

Including Ostron Armor from Hok in Cetus, and Solaris Armor from Rude Zuud in Fortuna! That’s 8 unique Armor sets in total to collect! The most ever released in a single Update!\nPLUS, each Syndicate (excluding Ostron and Solaris) has new Emotes based on familiar Railjack Crew animations!\nAll of these new Offerings are Tradable!\n\nVeiled Riven Cipher (one a week)\nThis cipher can be consumed to identify the selected Veiled Riven to bypass its Challenge.\nReplaces Transmute/Cycle button in Mod Segment  when a Veiled Riven is selected.\n\n\n\nWith the number of new Steel Path rewards being introduced in this update, we wanted to address those strategies, while also bringing up the lower average. We hope these changes reinforce one of this update’s main themes \nyou should be able to play the game however you want, without feeling forced into prevalent strategies.\nAcolytes will now spawn more frequently during Steel Path missions, resulting in more Steel Essence being dropped overall!\nSteel Path Incursions will each offer a reward of 5 Steel Essence, increased from 3. \nSteel Essence will now remain on the ground for 5 minutes before disappearing. If the UI marker is blinking, be sure to get it before it’s gone!\nFor consistency, Vitus Essence follows the same rules and will remain on the ground for 5 minutes before disappearing. \nAcolytes will now be teleported to a safe location if pulled into water. This fixes Itzal’s Cosmic Crush pulling Acolytes into water volumes where they instantly died. \nFixed Acolyte spawns becoming extremely slow or stopping altogether in specific Steel Path mission types \nmost commonly reproduced in Disruption or Survival.\nAcolytes will now drop 1 of 6 New Arcanes on death!\nPRIMARY MERCILESS\nOn Kill:\n+30% Damage for 4s.

Not all weapons are built equal, but ideally there are several answers to each query, so that Tenno can make their own choices from a variety of options and keep things fresh. If one category of weapons outclasses all the others, or makes them feel redundant, then we as developers want to step in to make sure choice exists for the sake of fun.\nEnter melee weapons, and equally importantly, the Mods you can use on them. Tenno have spent years sharpening their blades, but as a result, we’ve seen Primary and Secondary weapons collecting rust. And the longer we avoid addressing it, the worse this divide will become.\nOur goal is to encourage you to use your entire Arsenal in-mission. Switching between Primary, Secondary, and Melee weapons should feel like valid and strategic options, in contrast to the uncontested Melee dominance that exists in the current meta. We want Melee to be fun and powerful as you rip and tear your way through the solar system but we want players to have that same level of fun and power with Primary and Secondary weapons should that be their preference.\nMelee Mod Nerfs\nWeapon Changes\nPrimary and Secondary Weapon Arcanes\nGalvanized Mods\nLogin Items\nIf you’d rather watch a video going over this Workshop and the Sisters of Parvos Update at large, check this out:\n\nWe have 5 categories of changes coming:\nAttack Speed increases for Melee are part of what makes it so dominant. This is especially true when the conditions to reach animation-breaking Attack Speed are as simple as current Berserker: ‘on Critical Hit’. Infinite Attack-Speed Uptime is possible with a single Mod, and the result is animation noise with no distinction between hits, coupled with massive Damage output.\nWe still want to support the ability to increase your Melee Attack Speed and Damage Output, just not to the levels you currently can.\nBerserker is changing from:\n+30% Attack Speed (Max 75%) for 24s on Critical Hit\nTo:\nBerserker Fury, cannot stack with Fury. \nOn Melee Kill:\n+35% Attack Speed (Max 70%)  for 10s. Stacks up to 2x.\nThis is important because:\n\nIt decouples it from Critical Chance.\n\nAdds a more defined ramp up using ‘On Kill’ instead of On Crit (which frequently meant 0 to ‘Max’ in one swing hitting 3 enemies). \n\nRenamed to Berserker Fury to communicate that it can no longer be equipped with Fury / Primed Fury.\nBlood Rush’s maximum value is being lowered.This changes the achievability of consistent Red Crits from just one Mod (on most Melee weapons, some High-Critical exceptions), and now additional help will be needed via Mods, Arcanes, or Warframe abilities to achieve consistent Red Crits.\nOne Mod alone generally delivering the best tier of Criticals felt too powerful.\nBlood Rush is changing from:\n+60% Critical Chance stacks with Combo Multiplier\nTo\n+40% Critical Chance stacks with Combo Multiplier\nThere should now be a more meaningful choice: do you want front loaded damage or a build up from multiple Status Types?\nCondition Overload is changing from:\n+120% Melee Damage per Status Type affecting the target.\nTo\n+80% Melee Damage per Status Type affecting the target.\nIn late 2020, we reworked the Glaive melee class to be more powerful and comfortable to use. Overall, we feel these changes had their intended effect as weapons like the Glaive Prime skyrocketed from obscurity to the top of the pile with their newfound ability to inflict huge damage using heavy attacks.\nHowever, these changes also introduced a common issue: players with high melee attack speed would sometimes accidentally throw their Glaives when trying to perform simple melee strikes, and the “catch and release” mechanic sometimes resulted in multiple unintended throws. In reviewing our Melee system, we felt it was a good opportunity to address this concern, while also doing a balancing pass to reflect the power in this newly reworked melee class.\nThat said, our two changes to Glaives go hand in hand:\nCerata\nDirect Hit Damage from 366 to 201\nRadial Damage from 549 to 333\nFalcor\nDirect Hit Damage from 460 to 250\nRadial Damage from 690 to 345\nGlaive\nDirect Hit Damage from 210 to 116\nRadial Damage from 315 to 190\nGlaive Prime\nDirect Hit Damage from 328 to 180\nRadial Damage from 492 to 296\nHalikar\nDirect Hit Damage from 298 to 163\nRadial Damage from 447 to 225\nHalikar Wraith\nDirect Hit Damage from 503 to 263\nRadial Damage from 621 to 329\nKestrel\nDirect Hit Damage from 168 to 92\nRadial Damage from 252 to 126\nOrvius\nDirect Hit Damage from 390 to 215\nRadial Damage from to 520 to 293\nPathocyst\nDirect Hit Damage from 524 to 288\nRadial Damage from 786 to 393\nXoris\nDirect Hit Damage from 240 to 120\nRadial Damage from 480 to 250\nWe are indeed touching 1 non-Melee item in the series of Nerfs, and likely to no one’s surprise it’s the Kuva Nukor. It’s a dominant Secondary with incredible power, which is warranted given its acquisition. It’ll keep all of its signature behaviour, but the general output is being notched down slightly with the following change:\n\nChains targets reduced to 2 from 4\nReduced the Vermisplicers tendril chains from 5 to 3.\nAfter the original publication of our Dev Workshop, we observed and noted that the Vermisplicer’s behaviour is very similar to the Kuva Nukor. To this end, we wanted to ensure we were consistent in handling the beam chain weapons in this update.\nWith all the information about how we are lessening power in some ways, let’s move onto the way we are increasing the power available to Primary & Secondary weapon options.\nBecause the Gunplay falloff is more of a late-game problem, these new Upgrades will be earned through late-game content systems -\nnamely, the Steel Path. You’ll be able to get the Arcane Slot Unlockers from Steel Path Honors, whereas the Arcanes themselves drop from Acolytes in the Steel Path! The spawn frequency of Acolytes is also being increased, meaning you’ll get more Steel Essence, as well as more chances for the Arcane you want. All Acolytes will drop them!\nThere are 6 Arcanes (3 Primary, 3 Secondary) that you’ll be able to rank up and put to put into the new Slots:\nThe more you kill, the more damage you can build up. Groovy!\nThe second Primary Arcane is designed with high precision weapons in mind. Make your Headshots count for greater performance (excluding AOE headshots)!:\nThe final Primary Arcane is designed with using your full loadout in mind, enter Melee synergy:\nThe stats are the same for the Secondary versions of the New Arcanes:\nUltimately each Arcane stacks up to the same amount of damage, but it’s how you choose to get there that counts. Precision? Spray and Pray? Melee synergy? Your choice!\nThe “Arcane Adapters themselves are an item you’ll need to install on the weapons you want to take further, and you can find the Primary and Secondary Arcane Adapters in the Steel Path Honors. The Arcanes themselves drop from Acolytes on The Steel Path.\nOur observation that Arsenal imbalance becomes obvious at higher level content means that we want your progression to this content to matter for your power level. We want to give you the tools to progress to optimal play with a new series of Mods: Galvanized Mods!\nNew Galvanized Mods:\nGalvanized Crosshairs\nGalvanized Diffusion\nGalvanized Shot\nGalvanized Scope\nGalvanized Chamber\nGalvanized Aptitude\nGalvanized Hell\nGalvanized Acceleration\nGalvanized Savvy\nAs with many of our large-scale reworks and changes in the past, we want to honour the investment of time and resources our players have put into their Arsenal! Since these changes are both wide-sweeping and precise, we have a general login inbox planned for all players, with a few bonuses for those who meet certain conditions.\nWith the release of Update 30.5: Sisters of Parvos, players will receive the following upon login:\n\nAll Players Mastery Rank 5 and above will receive 5 x Built Forma.\nAll Players Mastery Rank 5 and above will receive a 3-Day Affinity Booster.\nAny Player who owns a Kuva Nukor will receive an extra 2 x Built Forma.\nAll Players who owned ANY Lich Weapon at any point OR have a Converted Lich OR have an active Lich get 1x Requiem Ultimatum (a new item to taunt a Lich or Sister into battle)!\nPlayers who have Converted a Kuva lich OR vanquished a Kuva Lich will get OULL, which is a Requiem Wildcard Mod!\nThe delivery of these changes is rooted in our goals, and if we miss the mark we’ll be watching for what to tweak. Keep in mind what our goals and visions are when you give feedback after playing!\nCritical Delay \nCritical Chance from 187% to 200% -36% fire rate to -20% fire rate\nCreeping Bullseye \nCritical Chance from 187% to 200% -36% fire rate to -20% fire rate\nCritical Deceleration \nCritical Chance from 48% to 200% -30% fire rate to -20% fire rate can no longer stack with Blunderbuss/Primed Blunderbuss*** If we release that.... ;) Maybe. \nCautious Shot increased from 90% to 100%\nThe Sisters of Parvos update will bring three new Modular Hound Companions, each with a unique Melee weapon. While reviewing these Companion Weapons, we noticed the Helios-old problem that there’s a lot of Melee Mods that you can equip, but don’t really function on companion Melee. There’s also some ‘invisible gear hopping’ where if you put Mods on your Deconstructor (or Prime), they carry over to your Melee which is a many-year-old oversight we’ve lived with, but are approaching changes more thoroughly with this Update and as a result we’re patching up this behaviour.\nThese are mostly Mods that deal with combos or heavy attacks, since Companions do not have these features as well as other certain outliers. As a result the following Mods will be incompatible with the upcoming three Hound weapons and retroactively will no longer work with the Deconstructor and Deconstructor Prime:\nAmalgam Organ Shatter\nCorrupt Charge\nEnduring Strike\nBody Count\nBlood Rush\nDispatch Overdrive\nDrifting Contact\nEnergy Channel\nFinishing Touch\nFocus Energy\nFocused Defense\nGuardian Derision\nKilling Blow\nLife Strike\nMaiming Strike\nParry\nQuickening\nReflex Coil\nRelentless Combination\nSeismic Wave\nTrue Punishment\nWeeping Wounds\n \nGladiator Might\nGladiator Rush\nGladiator Vice\nCarnis Mandible\nJugulus Barbs\nSaxum Thorax\nMotus Impact\nProton Snap\nTek Gravity\nStrain Infection\nThis is similar to other MMOs, you won't retroactively get leveled up for past play when the Helminth level cap increases.\nHelminth Invigorations are here! Take a seat, Tenno. Helminth has some flavours of the week!\nEvery week, your Helminth will have an Affinity toward 3 Warframes. You can interact with Helminth with these Warframes to gain select Weekly Buffs (one Offensive and one Utility/Defense)! For example:\nZephyr: 200% Power Strength and Immune To Status\nAtlas: 200% Primary Critical Chance and +1000 Armor\nExcalibur: 250% Melee Damage and 75% power Efficiency\nOnce you infuse the Invigoration, it lasts the week before the power of the Helminth wears off. Check back each week to see what options your Helminth has for you!\nThe Helminth takes note of your interactions \nfor every 10 Invigorations you do, you’ll be able to Select what Warframe receives the next buff!\nThe below are our continued efforts to streamline the Companion System structure that is now almost 7 years old! With a combination of Community feedback and internal desires we’ve changed the following:\n\nThe following changes occurred due to the following scenario being shared:\nA player reported that combining Umbral Mods + Adaptation + Lightning Rod on any Warframe made them fully immune to all damage from the Hydrolyst Eidolon.\nPrior to this discovery, we already made sure we couldn’t reach 100% Damage Resistance because that would just be excessive in all cases. You can see this in action when we capped the ‘In Air’ Damage Resistance Mods. Even though the Mods theoretically could reach 100% Damage Resistance, there is a hard cap at 90%.\n0.75 x 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.75 = 31.5% damage taken AKA 68.5% damage reduction\n\nJugulus Rex enemies drop the Necramech Mods from Operation: Orphix Venom:\nNecramech Deflection\nNecramech Rebuke\nNecramech Repair\nNecramech Enemy Sense\nNecramech Augur\nNecramech Rage\nNecramech Aviator\nVala Community Glyph by FrostyNovaPrime\nGara Prime Community Glyph by SpaceWaifu\nYareli Community Glyph by Joriale\nYareli Community Display by Trash_Frame\nVala and Parvos Community Display by Finlaena\n\n\n\nDoubled the Vitus Essence drop rate from Arbitration Drones to 6% from 3%!\nVitus Essence will now remain on the ground for 5 minutes before disappearing. If the UI marker is blinking, be sure to get it before it’s gone!\n\nAmmo Chain will now give Mausolon 1800 Ammo pool instead of 1799.\nAdjusted the Infested screen FX (Jordas Golem, Cambion Drift Fass pool FX) to be more orange, as the previous red was being mistaken for blood/Health damage.\nRenamed ‘REGALIA’ to ‘SIGILS’ to aid in New Player understanding.\nUpdated all of New Loka's mouth shapes for the visemes to improve the overall quality.  \nUpdated all of Nora Night’s visemes so it uses all the correct mouth shapes.\nAdded ‘Available Sessions’ icons to Friends list to indicate when players are available to join. \nUpdated Flux Rifle muzzle FX.\nUpdated the Clan ‘View Permissions’ pop-up.\nAdded “Ready for Ascension” and “Accession Ceremony in Progress:” information as a on-hover popup in the Clan management window. \nImproved shading and shape definition of Operator faces.\nThe Archwing Galvanized Blade Mod has been renamed to Conductive Blade so that it doesn't get confused with the new Steel Path Galvanized Mods. \nUpdated Boon’s visemes \nbetter lipsyncing for our favorite K-Driving rebel. \nUpdated the Trade error message to “Failed to make offer; your trade partner already owns one or more of these items and cannot receive a duplicate.” when attempting to Trade a Skin that a player already owns. \nAdded ability to hover over currencies in the top right bar for their names and descriptions.\nAdded missing charge/reload sound FX from Ground Archwing Guns to the Space versions.\nPlayers can now install an Orokin Catalyst / Orokin Reactor onto ungilded Modular items, specifically: \nKitguns (Primary + Secondary)\nZaw (Melee) \nModular Companions (Moas + Hounds)\nBeing unable to install a Reactor or Catalyst onto an ungilded modular item significantly slowed down progression on new Modular items. Players who were willing to make the investment into Modular items weren’t able to Mod them to their full capacity, which left their new gear feeling very underpowered. So we have removed that restriction!\nChange armed camera offsets when riding the K-Drive to allow for easier view of combat.\nUpdated Sequence Burn Spectra Mod from +Range to +Beam Length.\nAll K-Drives can now do a grind Slam Shockwave! Bomb the landin’ K-Drive Mod will now buff the Damage and Range of the Shockwave.\nAdded small and large grind slam FX and set the default Board to its original orange for K-Drives.\n\nGeneral system micro-optimizations.\nOptimized Dojo initialization time. \nMade micro-optimizations to world-state synchronization.\nMade some micro-optimizations to object creation code. \nMade micro-optimizations to Void Storm missions.\nMade micro-optimizations to kill tracking.\nImproved pixel-sharpness of the Launcher on high-resolution displays.\nFixed potential small memory leaks throughout the game.\nOptimized memory footprint for all platforms.\nOptimized an effect texture to save 300K of RAM. \nOptimized memory footprint in the Orb Vallis.\nOptimized memory footprint when spawning enemies.\nOptimized when opening up the Gear Wheel. \nOptimized memory footprint in all levels. \nMade Ayatan Sculptures dynamically load if needed rather than keeping all loaded all the time to save ~3.5MB.\nOptimized plant and foliage rendering for all platforms.\nOptimized away 2MB of heap memory for all platforms.\nOptimized code-size slightly for all platforms.\nOptimized memory use for all platforms. \nMade systemic micro-optimizations throughout the game.\nMade optimizations to HUD with missions that have blinking markers.\n\nFixed World State Tabs and button prompt icons for Steel Path overlapping when using a controller. \nFixed being unable to open the Crew Contracts menu at Ticker in Fortuna when using a controller. \nThe right trigger is now called out to access the contracts. \nFixed being unable to reliably select a mission node in Navigation while using a controller.\n\n",

  "fixes": "\nGara Prime: Update 30.3.0\n\nYou will notice the download size is 2.2 GB. There’s a few reasons why. First, it’s a Mainline. If you don’t know what that means, it’s when we deploy all pending changes to the game in a big batch. Second, it’s jammed with Quality-of-Life that is listed below for you to enjoy.\n\nGARA PRIME HAS ARRIVED!\n\nGARA PRIME\nContinue the legend of the glass-armored warrior Gara. Dominate the battlefield with the power and purity of crystal.\n\nASTILLA PRIME\nLoose explosive glass slugs that tear through enemies with Gara’s signature shotgun. Presented here in its spectacular Prime form.\n\nVOLNUS PRIME\nThe glorious original Orokin casting of Gara’s signature glass hammer. Deceptively light and swift, while remaining lethally effective.\n\n\nGet the newest Prime gear with Gara Prime Access and Prime Accessories here: https://www.warframe.com/prime-access\n\n\n\nWukong Prime, Zhuge Prime, and Ninkondi Prime have entered the Vault!\nWith this Vaulting comes the shift of the following Syndicate Sacrifices:\n\nReplaced Perrin Sequence Sacrifice of Wukong Prime Chassis with Atlas Prime Chassis.\nReplaced Perrin Sequence Sacrifice of Ninkondi Prime Handle with Baza Prime Stock.\nReplaced Steel Meridian Sacrifice of Zhuge Prime String with Pangolin Prime Handle.\n\nIf you already wield the power of these Primes or have their Relics in your Inventory, they will remain after the Vaulting.\n\nRiven Disposition Changes:\nAs with each round of Prime Access come updated Riven Disposition numbers. See the full Disposition changes here:\nhttps://forums.warframe.com/topic/1265139-may-2021-riven-disposition-updates/\n\nPLUS! As an added Gara QoL change, her glass armor no longer disappears during Splinter Storm!\nYou have requested many times (many, many, times) to have a UI toggle that will give you control over whether Gara's glass armor parts will \"shatter\" while using Splinter Storm. You want to use this power all the time, but it makes your warframe look so much less... shiny when you do.\n\nGiven how persistent and unified this feedback is, we've decided to simply make this power not remove her armor plates while it is active. Adding a toggle adds significantly more complexity to the code and significantly more chances for things to break than just not having the effect at all.\n\nWe hope this change will be appealing to everybody living on the cutting edge of Gara fashion.\n\nRailjack Changes & Fixes:\n\nCommand Intrinsic Crew Changes & Fixes:The following changes are a prelude to the release of the Rank 10 Command Intrinsic coming in the Sisters of Parvos Update! \nAdded a ‘Contracts’ tab to Ticker's ‘Hire Railjack Crew Members’ in Fortuna.\nYou can also end Contracts with the Crew Members that are not equipped from here. \nThis has been highly requested! You can now review your current Crew Contracts while perusing potential Hires to see what positions you have to fill or who might have to be replaced (get the boot!). \nConverted Kuva Liches can now be used as ‘On Call’ Crewmates.\nCrew Members now have more relaxed behaviour when not on a mission.\nCrew Members will now play transmission voice lines whenever they are being customized in the Dry Dock. More personality for your team!\nCrew Competencies are now visible in the Tactical Map when hovering over Crew Members. \nThis was highly requested to help make an informed decision when swapping Crew roles in the heat of battle.\nCrew Piloting the Railjack will now hold position when you are either in the Archwing Slingshot or using the Forward Artillery. \nTo help players engage their targets, the Pilot will prefer to point the ship at targets that you are aiming at.\nThis is also our first attempt at this function, so some future tweaking is to be expected!\nCrew piloting Railjack will now fly to attack the weak-point marker at the end of Railjack Volatile missions. \nUpdated all of New Loka Crew's mouth shapes for the visemes to improve the overall quality.\nFixed Crew attempting to get into the Forward Artillery and/or Pilot harness after giving all three Crew the ‘Gunner’ role.\nFixed hitch related to On-Call Crew Member attachments (Armor and Syandana).\nFixed Crew getting stuck in turrets if you tried giving them another order while they were still getting into the gun.\nFixed long Kuva weapon names escaping the bounds of the pop-up when viewing in Crew Equip and Contracts screens. \nFixed a case where the Crew Pilot would stop if all targets were too far away.\nFixed Crew assigned to Gunner after assigning another Crew member to the same position being unable to go into or stay in any of the Railjack turrets.\nImproved the ‘Abort’ Railjack mission flow by changing and fixing the following:\nThese changes come after reviewing why Clients in Railjack missions would often find themselves feeling unable to leave after mission completion in public squads. We determined that the language used in these scenarios was unclear/confusing and that there were several other issues related to how rewards were shown in the UI and saved to inventory that we have resolved below!\n‘Abort Mission’ will now update to ‘Leave Mission’ in the pause menu after successfully completing a Railjack mission. \nIt will also prompt a new message that better describes what will occur: “Leave Mission: You will keep mission rewards and XP earned to this point, but will disconnect from your squad. Are you sure you want to leave this mission?” vs. the previous “Abort Mission: You will keep progress but forfeit the completion rewards and bonuses. Are you sure you want to abort this mission?”\nFixed Clients not being able to ‘Abort’ Mission and retain their rewards once the mission objective has been completed. \nFixed the End of Mission screen not showing the full collection of rewards earned in the mission when returning to the Orbiter. \nFixed ‘Aborting’ Railjack Mission not awarding items earned from POIs.\nReduced the opacity on Railjack Armament Reticle UI that cannot be used during ‘Railjack Blink’.\nAdded “A Railjack is required to access Railjack Research” message to the Railjack Research console if you do not own a Railjack yet. \nAdded the ability to rebind the ‘Reload’ function in the Railjack bindings. \nMade updates to the machine sounds and radius in the Corpus POI airlocks.  \nFixed crash related to waypoint position in Pluto Proxima. \nFixed the Corpus Troop Spawn Racks in the POIs malfunctioning & ejecting you into space if you get caught underneath it as it's coming down. \nFixed being unable to leave the Railjack or fast travel when returning from a Railjack mission to a Relay. This also fixes the pause menu showing Dojo options instead of Relay. \nFixed using the Dojo Arsenal during Railjack mission countdown creating duplicate companions. \nFixed enemies not spawning in Volatile missions (after mission complete) when you had previously run an Exterminate or Sentient Anomaly mission and travelled directly to the next Volatile mission. \nFixed being unable to exit the Railjack Pilot and Turret seats after returning to the Dry Dock via pause menu.\nFixed Railjack Mods popup on pickup in mission using the old UI when they were still Avionics. They will now popup on the left side as Mods like other Mod pickups!\nFixed Electricity Hazards on the Railjack also affecting players’ HUD that are on Crewships. \nFixed being unable to use the Tactical Map while piloting stolen Crewships.\nFixed Railjack Shield gauge turning black instead of purple when the Railjack has Overshields. \nFixed another case of infinite loading from Dry Dock on the second mission if Host migration occurred after successful first mission. \nFixed Host and Client getting trapped in an infinite loading tunnel after aborting to Dry Dock from Void Storm mission. \nFixed location HUD popup being blank when entering the Dry Dock. \nFixed crash when entering Pulse Turbine POI.\nFixed script error when using ‘On Call’ crew. \nFixed cargo train entry objective marker not updating position after ejecting each car. \nFixed certain dropships not spawning in the Orb Vallis.\nFixed not being able to switch off of the Railjack Mods screen when viewing the Railjack console in the Orbiter. \nFixed Orphix missing collision in Orphix Railjack mission \nmaking it impossible to melee. \nFixed several FX lighting issues in the Gas City tileset that were causing bright light flashes.\nFixed sound FX popping on trams in the Corpus POIs. \nFixed ‘No Ability Found’ popup in Railjack HUD not being localized.\nFixed the ‘X’ button not working in the Railjack Crew Management screen while using a controller. \nFixed loss of functionality with the Pause Menu in Railjack missions if the player opens the Quick Progress View “P” as the “Mission Complete” pop-up appears.\nFixed being able to set up a Trade Shop in a docked Railjack. \nThis also fixes your Warframe getting stuck with their arm up in the trade position during the entirety of the mission.\nFixed Contributing and Rushing Wreckage causing the scroll position to reset to the top of the list. \nFixed ‘Wear and Tear’ slider not resetting when using the ‘Reset Default’ option in the ‘Customize Railjack. \nFixed researched Prerequisites in the Research console showing as ‘Not Researched’ and having a white background. \nFixed Larval state of Vulpaphyla Companion blocking view when in the Pilot seat.\nFixed hitches when viewing the Railjack End of Missions screen.\nFixed Corpus Railjack Capital Ship airlock not actually teleporting Clients into the Capital Ship.\nFixes towards transparency issues with a sign in the Corpus Railjack ship.\nFixed some Corpus Railjack Codex dioramas having flashing lights.\n\nNew Player Experience Changes:\nUI Changes:\n\nWe have done update passes on some of the social aspects of Warframe, with particular attention paid to screen reworks for Friends and Clans this time around!\n\nMultiple screens have been refreshed with a new look and certain new functionalities! All of the screens listed below also now all take on your chosen UI theme.\n\n‘Junction Tasks’ Screen Changes: \nRewards will now automatically scroll across the screen to give you a full preview of what will be earned on successful Junction completion.\nEach task now has a descriptive blurb to help direct you on how to get started on the task. \n‘Clan’ Screen Changes:\nEverything is now more neatly displayed on a single screen. Previously tucked away features such as ‘Edit Hierarchies’, ‘View Alliance’, ‘Invite Member’, and ‘Message of the Day’ are now immediately visible and accessible. \nIn addition to your MOTD, you can now also have a much longer Clan and Alliance message displayed below! All display on the right hand side of the Clan screen in the ‘News’ Tab. The option to edit the MOTD and message below is available in this window for those with permissions to do so.\nAdded more Clan information to the screen:\nAdded the total number of Clan members to the screen. \nAdded the ‘Founding Warlord’ to the screen. \nThe Alliance Screen has also been reskinned: \nAdded the total number of members to the screen (in addition to the previously live ‘Allies’ count).\n‘Friends’ Screen Changes:\nEverything is now more neatly displayed on a single screen. Previously tucked away features such as ‘Recent Players’, ‘Available Sessions’, and ‘Batch Remove’ are now immediately visible and accessible. \nAdded ‘Recruit Tenno’ option \nThis will take you directly to the ‘Refer a Friend’ page on the Warframe website to recruit your pals and earn rewards for doing so.\nYou can now “Favorite” Friends in your Friends list by right clicking on their name. Favoriting Friends will add a star next to their name and will bump them to the top of your lists, both when they are on and offline. If you wish to “Unfavorite” simply right click on their name again and select that option.\nCHANGES:\nAdded a \"To be continued...\" label to The New War in Codex if the third entry cinematic has been viewed. The third cinematic entry has also officially been titled “The Maker”.\nThis section now also displays completion state for cinematic entries.\nAdded a new dropdown to Quest Codex screen so players can now filter which Quests are displayed (ALL / STORY / SIDE / WARFRAME), ALL is the default option so that players aren't confused as to where all of their Quests went.\nRemoved the ‘BETA’ tag on the ‘Enhanced’ option under ‘Graphics Engine’ Display settings. \nWe’ve been working on this improved graphical mode for quite a while! It’s been available  to PC players since last year, and deferred rendering is now the standard for our current-gen console players. At this point we don’t have any reservations in encouraging everybody to try this mode.\nThe Verglas now has custom sounds for weapon fire!\nThe pickup animation now turns your Warframe to face the item being picked up. \nMoved camera on Baro Ki’Teer in his Offerings screen to be far more flattering during his Relay Visits. \nAdded FX when setting a Research Target or accepting a Daily Synthesis task from Simaris.\nAdded Minimap colors options to the HUD color customization options (does not apply to Tactical Map):\nGround\nOutline\nHigh Elevation Outline\nLow Elevation Outline\nUpdated Incubator Power Core description at the Incubator to include how to find them when you do not currently own one: “The first Power Core can be acquired by completing the Mars Junction. Additional recipes can be bought in the Market and built in the Foundry.” \nUpdated Nora Night’s visemes so that it uses all the correct mouth shapes.\nEximus units will now drop from the drop tables twice: Once from the base enemy type table and once from the Eximus table. \nMade numerous AI Navigation fixes and improvements in the Orb Vallis. \nUpdated Zephyr’s Tornado FX to the latest from her rework at the Clan Dojo Backdrops Research console.\nUpdated the daily Standing reached pop-up to \"You have reached your Daily Standing Limit with [Insert Syndicate]. Come visit again tomorrow.\".\nThe previous “Standing is at maximum for this syndicate” was misleading!\nChanged the Eris and Pluto Relays in the list of marked Relays in the Rising Tide Quest to the Saturn Relay if you aren’t in a Clan. \nRedeeming a Promo Code in the ingame Market will now show the claimed items in the success message.\nChanged the “None” Dojo Backdrop to a default option instead of a Recipe that must be researched.\nWe made this change because “None” is every room’s default when first constructed. We want this option always available instead of requiring more research on the part of Clans who wish to return a room to how it first appeared.\nThis change will deduct 1K Affinity from Clans that completed the research, but it will not affect the tiers of Clans who upgraded to a higher tier using this 1K Affinity. We will be running a script to refund Clans who spent Credits on “None” Backdrop research. Script run and done!\n*Missed Note: We now inject commas in Damage numbers for easier readability!\n\nOPTIMIZATIONS:\nFixed some potential hitches when accessing various Friends lists on the Orbiter. \nThis also fixes spot-loading with Sentinel weapons if you had no Sentinel equipped and Necramech equipment if you didn't have the Necramech Summon equipped. \nFixed a large amount of spot-loading when returning to the Dojo from a mission.\nLoading optimizations, mostly aimed at new consoles. \nImproved compression of Codex Fragment artwork.\n\nFIXES\nFixed Excalibur's Exalted Blade being invisible when using Pistols and Glaives.\nFixed an issue where Saryn's Molt would not spawn in the correct spot when transitioning from idle to jog.\nFixed Maroo’s Bazaar dock floor light having wrong texture/missing light.\nFixed a rare crash that could occur when a player using Sevagoth abandoned a mission.\nFixed quest tileset appearing in regular Grineer Sealab Defense missions.\nFixed issue in the 'Search for Father' stage in the Heart of Deimos Quest where the mission would not progress if you were on K-Drive before the objective appeared and got off before reaching the Necramech. \nFixed Necramech in the first stage of the Heart of Deimos Quest appearing in the wrong position.\nThis also fixes enemy spawn issues in this stage.\nFixed giant Moa standing in the camera view while configuring Moa companion at Legs in Fortuna. \nFixed Quests no longer being sorted to the top when they aren’t complete.\nFixed Vaulted Relics from appearing in codex/chat link as available.\nFixed AFK detection not working on players that were using moving parts in the Corpus Ship Defense missions. \nFixed Credit count in the Mission Progress screen showing as doubled when picked up as Operator.\nFixed music getting desynced (mostly between drums and melody) in the Corpus Ship tileset. \nMore fixes to overlapping UI while Lavos is dual wielding, as reported here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/md8wid/lavos_infusion_hud_element_overlaps_with_melee/\nAlso added a dual wield custom HUD offset handling for Atlas, Gara, and Saryn. \nFixed missing teleport volume in the Mastery Rank 15 Test causing players to fall out of the level. \nFixed an explosive barrel in Rotuma, Kuva Fortress ignoring the room lighting and shining bright like a diamond.\nFixed ugliness on certain enemies when they become Corrupted, and other instances of this style of effect.\nFixed some broken Bonewidow animations.\nFixed misaligned Pillar (was allowing visibility through the level to outside) in the Corpus Ice Planet tileset. \nFixed possible duplicate nodes appearing in the Codex as locations for certain rewards (like Relics). \nFixed incorrect Polish translation for “No Session Found”. \nFixed Host Operator Transference in the Orbiter Captura Scene disabling the pause menu for Clients.\nFixed lighting issues in the Grineer Shipyard tileset causing a large straight line above the horizon. \nFixed missing lighting on the extraction cinematic causing the Landing Craft to appear completely black in the Grineer Sealab tileset. \nFixed a purple overlay appearing in the Grineer Shipyard Hijack tileset textures (ex.

As a bonus to touching every texture in Warframe, we used this opportunity to ask ourselves “is there anything else we can do to improve textures since we are going through all the work of touching them for compression anyways?” The answer: Yes! In short, we have also made improvements to how detailed the game looks overall. Take a look for yourself (download them and go back and forth for best effect)!\n\n\n\nWe were originally a little conservative with the Baurahn Prime Ephemera as to not visually overwhelm. Based on your feedback post launch we’ve made a few changes:\nAggressively reduced required idle times for the dragons to trigger.\nEnabled Energy colouring for the dragons metal textures.\nPreviously the metal parts of the dragons were locked as gold. Now it takes the primary Energy colour, and if you have the secondary unlocked, the Energy element of the dragons will favour that \nso you can colour the metal with the primary and the Energy with the secondary.\nIncreased scale of the smaller dragons.\nFixed the Baurahn Prime Ephemera FX playing when in Navigation view, which can be visually overwhelming.\n\n\nAdded an additional 30 Nightwave Prestige Ranks (150 max).\nOur last Nightwave Prestige Rank increase proved to not be enough for those whose retroactive amount put them at the new max.

As detailed here! \n A sharp-eyed Tenno noticed a change with Eclipse's damage bonus using our new Enhanced Graphics engine setting, and it turns out Mirage had us all under an illusion. Eclipse changes its effect intensity based on how bright (or dark) your current location is. The game calculates the brightness by considering all the light sources that are affecting you.  The problem... Under the Enhanced Graphics engine, lighting is handled in a different way than the Classic way we've been using for years. So while playing Landscape missions the sunlight was not being included in the intensity. What looked like bright open ground lit by the sun was, as far as the game is concerned internally, gloomy and overcast. This will be fixed such that the Eclipse ability will consider the real-time sunlight under the Enhanced renderer. We cannot guarantee that the results will be exactly the same using the two equations, but any difference should be negligible.\nFixed Tusk Heavy Gunners doing unintended extreme amounts of damage. \nFixed Obelisk Requiem icons sometimes not being visible for Clients. \nFixed cases of Excavators that could spawn inside Cambion Drift terrain. \nFixed Force Feedback issues when firing the Mausolon. \nFixed the Cryptosuctus Fish having a hole in it.\nFixed Vulpaphyla name appearing as [PH] Chrysalis upon devolving into a larva state.\nFixed unlocalized system error messages sometimes being shown in the UI when experiencing network problems\nFixed texture streaming on placed Glyphs being missing unless you get close.\nFixed a problem with the Dynamic Resolution system.\nFixed Chat repeatedly opening and closing if you slowly press down on the left trigger of a controller.\n",

  "changes": "Heart Of Deimos: Update 29.1.0:\n\n\nThis series is dedicated to the first weapons new Tenno come across as they begin their Warframe journey. You can find all of these in the in-game Market!\n\nAugment your Warframe with this Subtle and sturdy Armor set.\nJump into the future with the high-tech style of the Oscira Collection. Includes the Oscira Armor, Sugatra, and Syandana. Plus, Oscira skins for Pistol, Rifle, Staff, Throw blade, Bow, and Longsword.\n\nAll of these can be purchased outside of the Bundle/Collection:\n*Edit: Corrected the Oscira weapon skin names. Originally they were dedicated to the new player starter weapons, but we then changed them to be universal Staff, Pistol, Thrown Blade, Rifle, Bow, and Longsword Skins.\n\n\nThis distinctive serpentine Sigil adds venomous menace to any Necramech. As a bonus, a Warframe compatible Snake Sigil is included when purchasing the snake Necramech Sigil!\nRusty but trusty. This skin revives the glory of the legendary Old War Necramech, Snake.\n*Find both the Snake Necramech Sigil and the Snake Voidrig Skin with the Necraloid Syndicate for Platinum in the Necralisk!\n\nTransform your K-Drive into a Velocipod! You can choose Purple, Green, and White Velocipod variants \nyou can color customize the bodies to suit your liking of course, the difference between them being their unique eye designs!\n\n*Find the Velocipod K-Drive Skins from Son’s Offerings for Standing in the Necralisk!\n\nThis update is a bit larger than normal (6.9GB) because it contains the first phase of our efforts to save you disk space! We didn’t quite save as much as earlier tests had suggested but it looks like this should save people at least 5GB after everything is finished.\nNote that when downloading the update the launcher will do an automatic optimize pass before downloading more (this is necessary to free up space for the new remastered content).\nFor full in depth details please visit The Great Ensmallening Dev Workshop: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1223735-the-great-ensmallening/\n\n\nKeeping within the realm of the “community-created Warframe” project, Xaku has received numerous changes based on your feedback! We welcome your feedback post launch in the official Dev Workshop: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1223976-upcoming-xaku-changes/\nWe consider these changes “Round 1” with more to come once players have graciously again provided their feedback!\n\n\nWe are making Void damage ‘True Neutral’ by removing the 50% resistance of Void damage on Cloned Flesh and Fossilized enemies \na long desired request for Void damage.\nCurrently, Void damage is relatively ineffective against Cloned Flesh and Fossilized enemies which greatly limits the use of Xata’s Whisper on Grineer and Infested enemies. In an effort to give it (and Void damage in general) more utility across enemy categories, we are removing this resistance so that it aligns with its neutral effectiveness against the other enemy types. It is important to note that Eidolons, Amalgams, and certain bosses will still maintain this resistance.\n\n\n\nBefore we jump into the nitty gritty, let’s revisit what the ‘Marked for Death’ Helminth Infusion is: Stun an enemy; a portion of the next damage you deal to it will be dealt to all enemies around it.\n\nWith Marked for Death now in the wild and being experimented with, it was apparent to not be working as intended by overwhelmingly nuking enemies left, right, and center when combined with certain loadouts and due to certain bugs. We recognize the players who brought this forward with understanding that it needs to be addressed. Let’s get into the meat of it:\nFixed Mods applying twice to the Marked for Death Damage portion dealt in the AOE.\nFixed base Damage using the Health/Shield Damage dealt and not capped at the Health+Shield the target had prior (e.g. enemy with 5 Health gets hit by 100 damage, and 100 damage is shared in AOE. It should just be the 5).\nRadial damage was never meant to exceed the target’s Health and this was our bad. The desired strategy we wanted was players prioritizing tank units like Heavy Gunners to do AOE clears since heavy units have more Health than normal, thus the radial AOE would likely be lethal, not just normal units. This issue combined with numerous bugs of Mods stacking meant this was way over powered. A key part of reviewing these changes will be ensuring that players understand the best case scenario we envision for the power is targeting high-Health enemies to do radial damage to weaker enemies. \nRemoved Critical Chance from Marked for Death radial AOE. \nCapped Damage multiplier stat to 75% and normalized Damage type mults.\nHere’s an example of normalized Damage type: if the Damage you deal is 0.5 Impact, 0.4 Slash, 0.3 Heat that sums to 1.2x but after normalizing they become 0.42 Impact, 0.33 Slash, 0.25 Heat.\nFixed Marked for Death with Arcane Trickery equipped triggering invisibility almost every time, because each enemy hit by the AoE has its own 15% chance to activate Arcane Trickery.\n\nAn accumulation of Community and Developer feedback have brought forth a handful of Avichea changes and fixes:\nAvicheas now correctly fly in circles around the spawn call area once they reach it instead of hovering directly above it, sometimes widely out of range.\nThis brings Avicheas in line with other flying animals like the Sawgaw, where they fly closer to the call point and land near it. \nDiversified ambient Avichea encounters so that they can either be encountered flying around an area or low down perched on the ground.\nPreviously ambient Avicheas were only found flying high in the sky, which could easily be missed to the busy eyes. \nIncreased the spawn chances of ambient Avichea encounters.\nImprovements towards Avichea animations.\nThis also fixes cases of ambiently spawned Avichea’s 'slowly ascending to the heavens'. \nFixed Avicheas (and Mergoos) not flying away when gunfire is nearby.\nBirds do as birds do \nWarframe ain’t no different! Being stealthy is key for catching these animals.\nFixed some Conservation trail start points appearing under the endocrine goo in the Cambion Drift.\nFixed inability to move, shoot, switch weapons or use Warframe abilities after hitting a dissolving corpse with the Infested Ebisu or Spari Spear whilst fishing.\n\nPlease note that the Conservation team has more planned in terms of quality changes and fixes \nstay tuned!\n\nImproved spawn rate of Fish in the Cambion Drift to be closer to past Free Roam behaviour. You should generally have a maximum time between fish of ~15 seconds instead of ~50 seconds.\nWe welcome your feedback if even further changes are needed! \nReduced the number of Fish parts required per Daughter Exocrine Assignment from 3 down to 2. This brings Daughters economy in line with Son, where the max number of requested parts is 2.\nFixed some various script errors that sometimes resulted in an inability to catch Fish.\nFixed Cambion Drift Fish spawning in the same spot over and over if you didn’t move.\nFixed throwing your Fishing Spear into Mag's Magnetize can lead to temporary or complete loss of functionality.\nFixed some jittery hands animations that play throughout the Fishing Spear throw+recall sequence.\n\nCurrently there is a 3 minute cooldown on every use of the Necramech Summon Gear item. We’ve changed the cooldown behavior of the Necramech Summon to reflect the following:\nIf the player's Necramech is still active, then the Necramech Summon only has a 10 second cooldown. Summoning it this way will move the Necramech to the player's desired position but NOT restore its Health/Shields/Energy.\nIf the player's Necramech has been destroyed, then the Necramech Summon has a 3 minute cooldown, and will have its Health/Shields/Energy refilled on summon.\nReduced the Necramech’s Shocking Iron ability sound loop.\nFixed summoned Necramech’s not having their Modded values when summoned again after dying.\nThis was an issue before the cooldown changes.\nFixed summoned Client Necramech’s having 0 Energy when summoned again after dying.\nThis was an issue before the cooldown changes.\nFixed rare case of a player's Warframe ceasing to exist after Transferring into a Necramech, resulting in an inability to Transference back into your Warframe.\nFixed personal Necramech losing all functionality after Transferring into a fallen Necramech and then summoning your own Necramech.\nFixed ability to interrupt the Necramech ground slam attack with another ground slam attack or normal melee attack. \nFixed Client Necramech’s appearing to run in place after Transferring out of the Necramech with forward momentum. \nFixed the Necramech appearing crushed around an Excalibur when viewed via Look Link or Mod Link.\nFixed the Necramech model clipping/overlapping with the Upgrade screen when accessed in a Hub/Town.\nFixed Necramech UI and regular weapon crosshair overlapping when attempting to access the Gear wheel via controller while in the Necramech. \nFixed Necramech weapon appearing blurry after Transferring into a summoned Necramech before the weapon opening animation finishes.\n\nDecreased the unguided flight time of the Alt Fire on launch from 0.06s to 0.03secs.\nDecreased the unguided flight time of the Alt Fire smoothing from 1s to 0.4secs.\nThis makes the Alt Fire projectile start to home in on their targets faster and curve more acutely towards them.\nDecreased Alt Fire re-arming delay from 0.2s to 0.01secs.\nThis decreases the time between being able to lock onto additional targets after the first.\nIncreased max lock distance from 60m to 80m.\nIncreased loose lock distance from 80m to 100m.\nThis increases the distance you can lock onto targets with Alt Fire from 60m to 80m, and lock won't be lost unless the targets move beyond 100m.\nFixed cases of the Sepulcrum Alt Fire not properly targeting enemies.\n\nOptimized performance of several user interfaces including the Nightwave and Void Relic Refinement screens.\nOptimized download of some parts of Warframe.\nMade a large number of small optimizations to the UI system.\n\nGeneral polish and cleanup of sounds in the Arsenal to remove unintended sounds.\n\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed Deny having poor hit detection on ragdolled or suspended enemies.\nFixed targets affected by Accuse have inconsistent hit detection based on weapon type (beam, bolt, etc).\nFixed a case of dealing self damage via Xata’s Whisper.\n\nFixed a crash when hovering over the Roar ability in the Upgrade screen on a Hildryn which had Balefire replaced by Roar via Helminth.\nFixed a crash that occurred when sitting in the Helminth chair with poor connection quality. \nFixed Infested Mobility buff effects never ending when under Rank 3.\nFixed Infested Mobility not being affected by Strength like the Arsenal stat screen claims.\nFixed Infusing a new ability via the Helminth to Config D, E, or F not showing the ability has been applied until the player loads into a mission.\nFixed Titania's Tribute HUD not working if Razorwing was overwritten via Helminth.\nFixed rare case of the UI showing that you have the exact Secretion % required but won’t let you perform the action. This was due to rounding values in the back end that aren’t visible in the UI.\nFixed missing check mark beside recently earned Helminth Rank until you close and re-open the Helminth interface.\n\nFixed inability to progress through some Corpus/Grineer Invasion missions due to an inability to enter the portal, and just getting put through a never ending loop that goes nowhere.\nFixed Carnis Set Mods not functioning for both Host or Client players.\nFixed cases where Limbo’s Banish could be cast with 0 Energy.\nFixed the Soma Prime's Hata-Satya Mod not respecting Multishot for Clients.\nFixed ability to apply Status Effects to the Deimos Saxum before Femurs have been broken.

This results in multiple Garv’s in the Cambion Drift when doing back to back Bounties.\nFixed issues with the Purify Deimos Bounty, where the 'samples' UI will decrease from 35-15 when a Host migrates. However, the collected amount doesn't reflect this switch and will be greater than the UI limit indicates.\nFixed the Latrox Une ‘upload’ phase skipping if there's a Host migration while collecting samples for Latrox Une.\nFixed the Deimos Claw Skin not applying properly to the Keratinos.\nFixed inability to quickly select the Secondary Emissive and Energy colors when attempting to customize Warframe/Weapon colour Appearance using the controller d-pad.\nFixed the default icons for Mutagen and Antigen samples in the Predasite/Vulpaphyla Revivification menu (Son at Necralisk) being swapped. \nFixed a section in the Harindi Crater within the Orb Vallis that resulted in your Warframe turning invisible, the minimap changing, and enemies not attacking you.\nFixed inability to spawn Deimos Saxum/Deimos Saxum Rex in the Simulacrum. \nFixed Tokens appearing in End of Mission screen with common items. Should now appear above regular Resources and Mods.\nFixed Khora appearing mangled in the End of Mission screen diorama.\nFixed Loki’s Invisibility ability aggressively color grading your surroundings \nvery noticeable in the Cambion Drift when your Energy color is neon green (lol).\nFixed towards the Necralisk door opening animation playing when the door is already open. \nFixed Inbox Gift messages not displaying the amount of items Gifted (ie 5 Forma, etc).\nFixed inability to exit the Shawzin with a controller if a key binding is changed since Start then becomes unbound.\nFixed the Gear Wheel overlapping the Void Fissure End of Mission Reward screen.\nFixed Credits Icon appearing slightly larger than intended in the End of Mission screen,\nAnother fix towards missing the Entrati Rank up cutscene if you opened the ESC menu right before the cutscene starts. \nFixes towards poor Extraction waypoint pathing in the Grineer Shipyards tileset.\nFixed Paris bow 3D draw sound not cutting off when bow is fully drawn.\nFixed some spot-loading that would occur when selecting an Infested Companion in the Arsenal.\nFixed possible spot-loading when going into a Town/Relay/Hub.\nFixed numerous script errors when encountering Latrox Une in the Cambion Drift.\nFixed a script error related to having Hildryn’s Balefire active while transitioning from Free Roam to Hub/Town.\nFixing a script error with the Railjack Tactical Menu.\n\nSide Note:\nIsolation Vault reward tables have been added to warframe.com/droptables!\n",

Anyone who has already ranked up will receive a refund script within the next few days.\nWe have also done a significant rebalance pass of Conservation’s role in the Entrati Economy based on feedback.\n\nReduced the Animal Tags required to complete a 1 Token Task by 50%.\nReduced the average number of Animal Tags required for ‘Capture Deimos Wildlife’ Tasks which give 3, 4, and 5 Tokens. \nFixed some ‘Capture Deimos Wildlife’ Tasks appearing as doubles, giving twice the intended Tokens without costing twice as much.\nAdded a ‘Daily Special’ for Conservation to match the Daily Special for Fishing design by request.\nIncreased the Bait Defense time from 60s to 90s and increased enemy reinforcements.\nLowered drop rate of the Infested anti-toxin during the Toxin Level phase to increase difficulty \nit’s too easy!\nToxin Level will now greatly increase if players leave the designated area in an effort to increase team coordination and difficulty. \nReplaced the Volatile Runner with a Deimos Runner in the Toxin Level phase.\nFixed a crash that could occur if the Host migrated during an Isolation Vault Bounty.\nThis also fixes having to repeat Isolation Vault stages if a Host migration occurred.  \nFixed a ‘worst case scenario’ procedural generation where some Isolation Vaults would not have the Reactive Crystal intact, which occurred in a 1 hour window last night.\nGeneral note re: Scintillant! We discussed it yesterday, and realized the Scintillant description was too vague in terms of other methods to acquire it and updated its description in the last Hotfix. Overnight, we ran stats and the amount collected was too low, which is widely accepted from the community to be the case. While we all start with baseline ‘0’ for new Updates, this Resource is an outlier in how slowly it’s being accrued, which is to say current pacing not our intention. They should feel like a revised Cetus Wisp, but when we compared the two overnight, and considering more people are playing Heart of Deimos and how many Scintillant are needed, they were lower to a degree that doesn’t make sense with their hookup. Here is how we are fixing that today:\nIsolation Bounty Necramech’s now have a chance to drop Scintillant.\nFixed issues with unable to pick up Scintillant within the Vault environments. \nIncreased the spawn chance and spawn radius size of Scintillant within Vault environments. \nRemoved Scintillant as one of the Weapons Entrati members ‘Parts Requisition’ Tasks.\nAdded a slight glow effect to the Scintillant to increase visibility.\nIncreased the audio loop sound effect when a Scintillant is nearby.\nPlayer-usable Necramechs that you can Transference into on the Cambion Drift no longer drop rewards. \nTransferring into a Necramech and then standing around waiting for it to die to drop rewards is far from the intentions of the Necramech system. We understand this is a frustrating oversight. Additionally, this was often bugged that only 1 person got the drop at all. Enemy Necramechs in the Isolation Vaults will still drop rewards, and now they’ll drop more of them (Scintillant). \nYou can now enjoy Deimos from afar as a new planet backdrop when back in your Orbiter!\nAppearance improvements towards Maggot and Crawler death FX. \nOptimized mining visibility more by preventing certain ‘pulsing’ aspects of the world overlapping nodes. \nOptimized locations of Esophage exit ports. \nReduced camera shake on the second stage of the Heart of Deimos quest.\nHydroid Rakkam Kraken will now be the deluxe version when casting Undertow. \nTweaked the holstered idle pose of the Keratinos to avoid clipping.\n",

This should now equally match when you see when Providing/Cutting Fish in Fortuna/Cetus.\nNote that this is a fix to the user interface: Despite the “Cut fish” summary previously not showing a number of some parts when you cut multiple fish at once, you did actually get those parts.\nFixed an Obelisk exploit with certain AI combinations. \nFixed an issue where starting a multiplayer mission just as the Wyrm’s were rotating could cause level issues. \nFixed an issue with the truly ‘dead’ Mechs not looking deader-than-dead, meaning no Transference allowed.\nFixed Mod Link configs from Configuration B not showing Subsumed abilities.\nFixed issues with the Carnis Mod sets not functioning properly. \nFixed Esophage fast travel not working as intended on Clients.\nFixed a crash that would occur when in a Necramech when someone disconnects. \nFixed a crash that would occur when starting certain Cambion Drift Bounties.\nFixed issues with proper attachment/detachment of enemy Necramech arms for Clients. In some cases Clients saw Necramechs dying with both arms attached when in fact they were shoot off and weakspot exposed.\nFixed some Conservation Lures failing to find a path and possibly creating script errors once activated.\nFixed an issue with loading screens for Earth and Mars looking incorrect.\nFixed enemies not targeting the Operator after dying in a Necramech.\nFixed missing sounds for the Predasite and Vulpaphyla Precepts.\nFixed the Kymaeros having a description for Alloy Plate and other erroneous descriptions.\nFixed an issue where Operators could be used to bypass a part of the Heart of Deimos quest. \nFixed inability to shot for the entire hover duration when in a Necramech.\nFixed Xaku’s ‘Vast Untime’ damaging Teralysts and Variants.

Visit the Entrati Syndicate Fishing member within the Necralisk to master the art of Infested Fishing!\nOnce you have completed the Heart of Deimos Quest, a new vendor will be able to provide you with the Spari Spear, as well as provide a location to turn in Fish for fish parts. The Fish on Deimos are unique creatures, so make sure you have the right equipment!\nDuroid \nA living fossil hearkening back to the Orokin era, this elusive fish hides below the surface of Exocrine pools in the deepest caverns it can find.\nAquapulmo \nThese fish were purposefully contaminated with the Infestation as an Entrati 'experiment'. They feed off the organic deposits in cave systems.\nKymaeros \nThe Infestation has suborned these fish to its own purposes, using them as antibodies to repel the non-Infested. They swim through and above the Exocrine found on Deimos’ surface.\nChondricord \nA triumph of Orokin bio-engineering, these hardy fish have adapted to the Deimos environment and seem oddly resistant to Infestation. They thrive in cave environments.\nVitreospina \nWhatever higher functions this fish once had have been consumed, leaving it a mere automaton of metal and flesh. It ekes out a primitive existence in cave systems.\nBarbisteo \nAs ravenous as the Infestation itself, this fish feeds on the remains of others. It shuns the light, preferring an enclosed cave environment.\nMyxostomata \nThis exceptionally rare breed of fish is almost extinct, as its gilded Orokin flesh has a special savor for predators. It warily conceals itself in caves.\nOstimyr \nCrammed with redundant, mutated internal organs, this pungent fish is highly sought after. It only emerges from surface pools in the light of the Wyrm Vome.\nCryptosuctus \nFormerly Orokin scavengers, these fish succumbed to the Infestation long ago and now greedily feast on floating spores. They are found all over the surface of Deimos.\nGlutinox \nThese hefty fish are cannibalistic. They rise by Vome's light to absorb rare gases, retreating when Fass ascends to devour their smaller kin in their lairs.\nAmniophysi \nThese fish hatch out of translucent pods formed in the Infested landscape itself. The radiance of Fass stirs them into activity.\n\nFaceted Tiametrite \nCommon\nPurged Dagonic \nCommon\nPurified Heciphron \nUncommon\nStellated Necrathene \nRare\nTrapezium Xenorhast \nLegendary\nCabochon Embolos \nLegendary\nAdramal Alloy \nCommon\nTempered Bapholite \nCommon\nDevolved Namalon \nUncommon\nThaumic Distillate \nRare\nThe Cambion Drift is a hostile world. Even though several native species have adapted to surviving amongst the rampant Infestation, they still fall prey to it and its attacks. The Vulpaphyla and Predasite are no exception and are threatened by its vicious nature. You can save these Conservation creatures by wrangling them from the wild Infested landscape so that they may be treated at the Necralisk hub. There, you can assist in the administering of treatment and “Revivificate” them into Companions.\n*Please note Infested Companion Imprints will come in another Update.\nHere’s how it works:\nFirst you must tranq and capture a Vulpaphyla or Presadite in a wounded state (creatures affected will have a certain glow to them after they have been wounded by the Infested). You must encounter these creatures while they are infected and tranq it before it loses its battle with the Infested. The captured Vulpaphyla or Presadite is then transported to the Necralisk.\nWithout intervention, these creatures are likely to succumb to the Infestation. Return to the Necralisk and speak to the Conversation Vendor to treat them with a mix of Mutagens and Antigens to heal it of its ailments.\nVisit the Conservation Vendor and select “Vulpaphyla/Presadite Revivification” to get started in restoring the creature. There are three elements that will bring the creature to a restored state so that they may fight alongside you. The options available in these categories will determine the characteristics of your new Infested Companion:\nMutagens and Antigens can be purchased from the Conservation Vendor in Necralisk.\nAfter you have successfully saved the creature, you have the option to either keep or release it. Keeping the creature will make it available as a trusty Companion, while releasing the creature will put it back into the wild for a Standing gain with the Entrati.\n\n\nThree new Mod Sets are here! The Saxum, Jugulus, and Carnis Mod Sets can be acquired from the Cambion Drift Bounty Rewards or from respective Infested enemies in the Cambion Drift.\n\n*Acquire the Blueprints and Components for the Trumna from the Entrati Syndicate Weapons member!\n\n\n*Acquire the Blueprints and Components for the Sepulcrum from the Entrati Syndicate Weapons member!\n\n\nCustomize your Warframe’s Abilities at a depth never experienced before in Warframe! Introducing THE HELMINTH.\nThe Helminth System is an expansion of the Helminth room on your Orbiter \nyou may only know this room as an infested space that allows you to remove the Helminth Cyst. With the ‘Heart of Deimos’ Update, that’s all changing. The Helminth system enables you to customize your Warframes by infusing new Abilities in place of existing Abilities.\nOnce you’ve unlocked The Helminth System, you can fast travel to the Helminth Infirmary under the Equipment pause menu!\nDeep Dive:\nOnce ready, there are 2 key things this System offers:\n\nYou can replace 1 Ability per Warframe.\n\nEvery Warframe can be Subsumed to permanently provide 1 specific Ability to Helminth.\nInfused Abilities are removable with the click of a button \nthey will stay within a given Warframe as long as you decide you want it!\nSubsuming a Warframe is permanent  \nonly Subsume Warframes you are sure you do not want to play with. You can always re-earn or re-buy a subsumed Warframe.\nYou can deeply customize by only replacing Abilities on certain Configurations, as seen in the Demo! But we would like to expand this further to demonstrate just how deep you can go.\nYou can have 1 different Ability infused PER config!\nSo if you have Excalibur in the chair \nyou could put Shock on Configuration A, Molt on Configuration B, and Firewalker on Configuration C!\nFor example, if you wanted Shock applied to Excalibur on Configuration A but wanted Configuration B and Configuration C to stay default with Slash Dash, you can do so!\nAs you feed and use the Helminth system, you will rank up! Each Rank unlocks something different \nfrom a new power, to more Subsume Slots (max Rank Helminth = unlimited Subsume Slots), make sure you progress through the Ranks by regularly Feeding Helminth, Subsuming, and Infusing your Warframes!\nHelminth Provides unique abilities of their own:\n\"EMPOWER\"\n\"Increase the strength of your next Ability use.\"\n“ENERGY MUNITIONS\"\n\"Increase the efficiency of your Ammo consumption.\"\n\"INFESTED MOBILITY\"\n\"Increase your parkour velocity.\"\n\"MARKED FOR DEATH\"\n“Stun an enemy; a portion of the next damage you deal to it will be dealt to all enemies around it.\"\n\"REBUILD SHIELDS\"\n\"Instantly restore your shields.\"\n\"PERSPICACITY\"\n\"Automatically succeed at your next hack attempt.\"\n\"MASTER'S SUMMONS\"\n\"Heal your companion and call it to your side.\"\n\"EXPEDITE SUFFERING\"\n\"Affect enemies in a cone, removing any Bleed and Poison status from them and dealing any remaining damage not yet suffered in a single burst.\"\nIn addition to Helminth’s own Abilities, you can Subsume a Warframe to obtain 1 specific Ability permanently in Helminth’s memory (list below). We do not allow the Subsuming of any Prime Warframes, but you can Infuse Abilities on Prime Warframes! Warframes can be Subsumed at any Rank (do not need to be Rank 30).\nInfusion is the process of injecting a Warframe with an Ability \nwhether it be one of Helminth’s own, or another Warframes. Every Warframe can receive 1 Infused ability at a time in any Ability slot (i.e you could place Shock on any of the 4 Ability slots).\nSubsuming is the act of permanently providing a base Warframe into the Helminth’s biology. 1 Warframe can be subsumed every 24 hours.\nThe following table outlines the current Ability a given Warframe will provide on the Subsume action.\n\nIt was apparent in player feedback and our own play testing that these Infused Warframe Abilities had the potential to be the overwhelming choice; which is not ideal. Instead of changing the Ability outright due to those concerns, we decided to give them slight rules when Infused.\nFor example, if you replace Grendel’s ‘1’, your kit doesn’t really work! If you change around or re-assign Abilities already assigned to Railjack Tactical use, you simply may not have one, or have a new one in its place! If you put Hildryn’s PIllage on Inaros, you don’t get Shields, but you do get diminished Armor/Shields on enemies on cast.\nIt’s all up to you \nhave fun experimenting, Tenno!\nWarframes that are Subsumed join the Helminth in an eternal bond. They will live on in a Lotus flower that matches the colours of the Subsumed Warframe, as a permanent honor.\nDon’t like it? You can rename your Helminth at any time!\nWell, you’ll find out…\n\nCreated by the community in the Community Created Warframe project from theme to aesthetic to Abilities. Xaku’s concept art was made by community fan artist Eornheit!\nSince XAKU is a community Warframe, we will be doing a concerted second Phase of ability tweaks that is based on feedback on all platforms to ensure there are revisions from the community’s experiences. We will discuss this in a Dev Workshop as we get your feedback on our desks!\nSimilarly to Equinox, a toggle is available in the Arsenal to see Xaku in their “The Vast Untime” form.\n\n\n*Find the Quassus in the Market or the Blueprint in Entrati Bounties.\n\n\nFixed a progression stopping crash in The War Within Quest due to having a Moa Companion equipped.\nFixed inability to properly ‘hack the coolant tower’ in the final stage of the Vox Solaris Quest when playing in Solo matchmaking.\nFixed a crash when shutting down Warframe while in the Liset Customization screen.\nFixed a nasty hitch that would occur for Clients when streaming to a Free Roam level or warping in your Railjack.\nFixed Resource Drop Chance Boosters not affecting Riven Slivers.\nFixed a performance leak that could result in a crash due to the Terra Manker’s weapon FX never getting destroyed.\nFixed Excavators hovering slightly off the ground in one of the Plains of Eidolon cave tiles.\nFixed losing the ability to jump after equipping the Tranq Rifle while in Archwing.\nFixed Steel Path Junction Specters missing their additional Health.\nFixed the Xoris not appearing in your Warframe’s hand when performing a Stealth attack if it’s not the active/equipped weapon.\nFixed a script error that could occur if you were downed while doing Conservation.\nFixed missing context action when attempting to Wishlist a Market item when using a controller.\nFixed a long-standing problem with Transmissions being gamma incorrect (colors/lighting did not resemble the actual scenes).\nFixed issues where enemies would not attack Gara’s Spectorage mirrors.\nFixed UI offset issue in Orb Vallis Case Capture Bounty stages. \nFixed some tooltips with fixed positions being placed incorrectly when the custom Menu Scale slider is set to something other than 100%. \nFixed certain Syandanas such as the Paxis Syandana jittering at lower frame rates while in the Liset, Dojos, and Relays.\nFixed The Ballroom Simulacrum Arsenal context action clipping behind the Arsenal. \nFixed UI lockup that could occur when viewing loadout links from Chat. \nFixed file path appearing when upgrading Orbiter with the Kavat Incubator Segment.

More changes to come!\n",
  "changes": "Derelict Shift: Update 28.3.0:\nAdded Collapse/Expand buttons (arrow with a +/× inside).\nRewards can be sorted by IMPORTANCE, NAME, or TYPE.\nThe Rewards section now has a Search bar.\nSTATS and PROGRESSION can be selected via the bottom right of the screen.\nEnd of Mission screen now includes “Medals”! These are fun stats that highlight unique mission achievements aside from the usual, such as Lockers Opened, Syndicate Medallions Found, and much more!  \nMore Medals to come as we continue working on these UI screens!\n2020-08-12 10-50-10.mp4Unavailable\n\nResource Drop Chance Boosters now apply to Steel Essence and Riven Sliver drops within Steel Path missions.\nTo confirm player theories and clarify, previous to this Hotfix Resource Drop Chance Boosters did not affect Steel Essence or Riven Sliver drops in The Steel Path. It was not our intention to hide or subvert that information in game, and we should have clarified more quickly that this was the case.\nSaying this doesn’t change what appears to be the broader issue, which is concerns with Steel Essence drop rates. We are still gathering data on acquisition rates \nbut ultimately we are all hands on deck working to make Heart of Deimos the best it can be for August 25th. As of this Hotfix, any Tenno who have already walked The Steel Path will receive a Resource Drop Chance Booster.\nThis Hotfix ensures that Resource Drop Chance Boosters work within The Steel Path for Riven Slivers and Steel Essence. They were initially turned off to ensure the inherent Steel Path Resource Drop Chance Booster worked as intended. Like the initial Arcane Marketplace in Scarlet Spear, we wanted to ensure the automatic ‘100% Steel Path Resource Drop Chance Booster’ didn’t unintentionally scale for Resources specific to the Steel Path (Riven Slivers and Steel Essence). This unfortunately also affected player obtained reward Resource Drop Chance Boosters.\nThank you all for the feedback so far on The Steel Path, it helps to shape our knowledge and decisions moving forward.\nZephyr’s Airburst Ability now has 2 behaviours based on if you’re HOLDING to cast vs TAP to cast:\nZephyr’s Airburst original functionality is now activated by HOLDING to cast.\nGenerate a burst of massively dense air that explodes on contact and sends enemies flying. Launch Airbursts into Tornadoes to make them grow.\nBy TAPPING Zephyr’s Airburst, it now sucks in enemies instead of pushing them away. \nIncreased Airburst projectile speed by 50%.\nIncreased Airburst casting animation speed by 20%.\nWell of Life now passively heals allies in a radius around the target (base 100 Health per second within 8 meters). Shooting the held target gives extra Health to all allies in range (base 1% of damage dealt to the victim) instead of only the person who made the attack.\nWell of Life also no longer increases the Health of the target (this was an old solution to prevent other players from killing the target too fast). Instead it now uses a more modern approach similar to Nyx’s Mind Control where the Damage gets stored and dealt at the end of the Ability.\nIncreased the Cold Status Effects from 1 to 6 for these Frost Abilities (which brings it back to pre-Status Changes): \nFreeze (Area of Effect)\nIce Wave (slow) \nAvalanche (slow)\nIvara’s Artemis Bow now has 20% Status Chance per projectile. Also slightly tweaked how Status Chance and Multishot are displayed in Arsenal stats.\nMade Loki's decoy more visible with darker Energy colors and will now use secondary Energy colors.\nTweaked Mag's Greedy Pull to pull over 0.75 seconds (down from 1.0).\nWukong’s Iron Staff now has a 100% Damage block.\nAll melee weapons are intended to have perfect blocking after Melee 3.0, Wukong’s staff just slipped through the cracks.\nWarframe Blueprint and Component costs from Simaris have been reduced by 50%!\nOperator Amps damage conversion Arcanes now convert to 98% max so they can always deal a bit of Void Damage.\nThe Defense alarm will now sound at the start of every Wave in Orokin Defense missions.\nAdded the ‘infinite’ UI symbol to the Zeniths Secondary Fire Punch Through.\nIncreased Jackal Grid Wall damage attack but removed its ability to apply a Status Effect.\nAdded a Parazon spinning Revive animation when Reviving a player with the Parazon equipped.\nImprovements towards AI pathing flow in Corpus Ship tilesets.\nRemoved unintended dirtiness on the Limbo Limina Collection items.\nEvery squadmate now gets a single Dojo Pigment drop per enemy killed, rather than 1 player getting 1-4 Pigments.\nUpdated ‘Solaris’ named Dojo decorations to ‘Orb Vallis’.\nMade a slight boost to the muzzle flash size to improve visibility on Corinth Prime.\nCleaned up Melee grip FX across all Prime, Syndicate, Prisma, etc. weapons.\nAdded FX pulses to K-Drive Race points. Also removed a rogue point in one of the Orb Vallis Races.\nCleaned up the Lenz FX.\nMade micro-optimizations to some UI screens/systems.\nOptimized UI text rendering.\nMade a number of micro-optimizations to UI and FX rendering.\nMade some micro-optimizations for dual-core systems with simultaneous multi-threading.\nMade several micro-optimizations to flash rendering.\nMade some micro-optimizations to rope physics.\nMade systemic micro-optimizations to the script runtime.\nOptimized level load-times.\n",

  "changes": "Update 28: The Deadlock Protocol:\n\nWe are Desire. Ours is the grasping golden hand. We. Are. Corpus.\nNef Anyo claims to have found an heir to the long-deceased Corpus Founder, Parvos Granum, and has the means to prove it. The Solaris have begun disappearing in droves and Eudico thinks it has something to do with Nef’s power play. Whoever they are, the heir to the Founder would be able to solve the stalemate and stage a total takeover of the Corpus Board. If Nef Anyo has anything to do with it, that spells bad news for the Solaris.\nThe Deadlock Protocol sheds new light on the industrious origins of the Corpus, introduces the time-bending Warframe, Protea and includes a remastered Corpus fleet full of innovative threats and escalating security measures.\nTo begin The Deadlock Protocol Quest, make sure you have completed the Vox Solaris Quest. The Deadlock Protocol Quest can only be done Solo and you must be at least Mastery Rank 4; ready yourself!\n*Players who purchase the Protea Warframe before playing the Quest will receive a Riven as an additional reward.\n\nAs you infiltrate Corpus vessels, fight enemies and generally interrupt the pursuit of Grofit, the Corpus will use every piece of their security arsenal to stop you.  Be prepared for upgraded Turrets and such deadly reinforcements as mine-deploying Corpus Treasurers.\n\nExperienced Tenno can enjoy seven days of Jackal Sorties following release, where you can take on the reworked Jackal in a high-level area!\nOut of desperation to locate any last trace of the long-dead Founder, Nef Anyo has developed a way to open Void portals. Eudico believes they’ve been kidnapping Solaris to use as guinea pigs and needs your help to rescue them.\n\nThe portals are built through Golden Hand Tributes, a spot of profit-worship for faithful Corpus. By spending their Granum Crowns, a valuable manifestation of their devotion, the Corpus can open a rift and send expeditions to Void sites.\nThankfully, you can use these Granum Crowns to your advantage. Collect three tiers of Crowns from Treasurers in your Missions, each signifying a higher level of devotion than the last: Granum Crown, Exemplar Granum Crown, and Zenith Granum Crown. Use them to initiate challenges in Missions, search for Corpus Temple Reliefs or negotiate the release of Solaris prisoners in exchange for Standing.\nWithin every Corpus Ship Remastered mission you’ll encounter a Treasurer: A devoted follower of Parvos and all he stood for, willing to dedicate his life to be the keeper of the tokens of his esteem. The Treasurer is guaranteed to spawn within 2 \n4 minutes in a non-endless mission, and between 5 \n8 minutes in an endless mission. The level of your mission determines the tier of Crowns the Treasurer will possess. Handle him with haste before he escapes with his sacred tokens!\nLevel Tiers are:\n0-15: Granum Crown\n16-30: Exemplar Granum Crown\n31+: Zenith Granum Crown\n*Granum Crowns will not appear from Treasurers until you complete The Deadlock Protocol Quest.\n\nGranum Crowns can also be spent at the Corpus Temple Reliefs in Missions to learn more about the Founder. Each new story you acquire will earn you Relief Decorations for your Orbiter!\n\n\n\n\n\nProtea is the first Warframe to have a Universal Aura Polarity to accompany her set of utility skills!\n*Drusus is seeking out myths and legends about Protea and will update the Leverian when he is ready.\n*Earn the Protea In Action Glyph during a limited time 72 hour weekend Alert on PC, starting Friday, June 12th @ 2 PM ET. Console will also run this Alert when The Deadlock Protocol Quest is live on their respective Platforms!\n\n\n\n*Protea’s Alternate Helmets will be added to the Nightwave Cred Offerings once The Deadlock Protocol is live on all Platforms.\n\n\nWhen we introduced separate Dispositions for each weapon variant back in November 2019, we planned to give new weapons a Disposition of 1 (the “average”), or matching the lowest member of the weapon family if it already had a Disposition lower than 1. Unfortunately, this meant that powerful new weapons (like the Kuva Lich collection) might have Rivens that start too strong, forcing reductions in accordance with our balance methodology.\nIn order to prevent this situation, we will be changing this policy: going forward, all new weapons will be released with the minimum Riven Disposition of 0.5. For The Deadlock Protocol, this includes the Dispositions on newly added Primary Kitguns, in addition to regular weapons (secondary Kitgun Dispositions will remain as-is.)\nFull details can be found here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1199009-riven-disposition-procedure-for-new-weapons/\nWe have added a brand new chat channel to Warframe! The ‘Questions and Answers Chat’ channel is now live to provide new and experienced players a place to seek and provide help in a dedicated and organized way. It will be toggled on by default for all new players entering the game for the first time, while Region Chat will be opt-in and can be enabled from Options. For existing players, your chat settings remain untouched but the Q&A Channel has been enabled on login.\nPlease read our “Guide to Using the Q&A Channel” before participating in the channel: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1199008-pc-coming-with-deadlock-protocol-new-‘qa’-chat-channel-use-guide/\nMany Tenno may wonder what our larger goal is here. We have many motivations for these changes, but one of the strongest is the role Region chat plays our report systems. It may come as no surprise to hear that Region chat is home to the most reports of any channel in Warframe. These reports are reviewed and acted on by the staff here at Digital Extremes, and consequences have always been in place for offensive content. However, some consequences were not strict enough. We are aiming to reset the onboarding experience and chat experience in Warframe by including a new default Q&A channel to provide a dedicated place for players to bring Warframe knowledge to a chatroom in a designated place.\nWe also aim to clean up Region chat for members who like having a place to simply discuss Warframe. Region chat will be opt-in, and Offensive Language reports dealing with hate speech will have enforcement that is not up for appeal. If you find yourself under account restrictions due to Offensive Language, our stance is very clear here: We have no tolerance. https://digitalextremes.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043974052-Code-Of-Conduct-Respect-for-all-in-Warframe\nDue to no longer having Stasis, if you currently have a pup Companion (not yet Matured), upon equipping it in the Arsenal the UI will prompt you to either Mature or let it roam your Orbiter. The option to let it roam is only available if you don't have a proper Kubrow/Kavat equipped. When starting an Incubation your current roaming Companion will be put away.\nThe ‘Nutrio Incubator Update Segment’ now entirely disables DNA degradation!\nThe Pets Breed is now displayed beside the Pets name in the description when viewing in the Arsenal.\n\n\nIntroducing a new Deadlock UI Theme that goes hand-in-hand with the industrious origins of the Corpus.\n \nYou can now change your Mouse Cursor Icon, Mouse Cursor Color, and scale your Cursor in size!\nDeadlock Protocol_Mouse Cursor Options.mp4\nThe Landing Craft Customize screen has been decoupled to provide the ability to mix and match your Landing Craft with whichever Override Air Support you want!\n \nStar Chart Nodes have been given a fresh new look and functionality upon hover!\nHovering over a Node will display a new tileset/accompanying enemy image and gamemode icons respective to the available game modes.\nUpon clicking a Node that has numerous game modes available, a selector will open within the window for you to choose your game mode.\nDeadlock Protocol_Node UI Selector.mp4\nAdded two new cursor sliders under the Interface tab in your Options to give you more ways to customize and improve how you navigate the UI with a controller to your liking:\n UI Cursor Acceleration: Adjust the rate the cursor accelerates when moving in a continuous direction can be changed. \nThe Sensitivity Option still determines the overall speed of the cursor, while Acceleration gives players the freedom to set how quickly they’d like to get from point A to B. \n UI Cursor Magnetism:  Adjust the level of “magnetism” (“stickiness”) there is between the cursor and interactive elements in the UI. \nBefore the update, the cursor was set to “stick” to items you pass over by default. It was sometimes helpful but often proved to be an annoyance that prevented you from having reasonable cursor speed on UI windows with many elements. Now, you are able to customize how the cursor “sticks” to these elements. Setting it to “0” simply means that there will be no friction whatsoever between the cursor and the UI elements.\nAdded tooltip to Mastery Rank on hover while viewing your Profile to show total Mastery Breakdown per category.\n \nAdded button to rewatch the Kuva Lich cinematic in the Lich Codex section.  \nUpon visiting a Syndicate in the Relay, the Syndicate donation screen now displays your full Inventory of eligible items, similar to selling Fish in Cetus.\n \nUpdated a handful of Helmet icons in the in-game Market to better fit the new themed UI.\nRemoved the option to set \"Battle Pay Caps\" in the Alliance Management screen as it is not currently relevant.\nThe ‘Reset Decorations’ has been removed from the pause menu and placed in the Decoration mode HUD as ‘Clear All Decorations’.\nTooltips have been added to Arsenal stats! For example, hovering over ‘Armor’ now gives you an example about what it does.\n \nUpdated trade windows at merchants in Cetus and Fortuna to use the latest inventory UI. \n \nAdded visual separation in Railjack customization screen between all other color settings and the “All Colors” option. \nUpdated the ‘Invasion’ gamemode icon!\nAdded “Join Any Crew” option to search for Open Squads in active Railjack missions that you can join in a given Proxima. If there are no open squads, a pop-up will prompt you to try again or launch a new session from your personal Railjack. \nWe’ve added this feature to save time and keep you from needing to hover over node by node to see if there are active squads on them.  \nAdded a ‘Scrap Wreckage’ button to the Railjack Components/ Armaments screens. This removes the step of having to manually go into your Inventory in order view a complete list of Wreckage to Scrap when over the Wreckage limit.\n \nFire hazards that spawn on the Railjack will now directly damage the Ship/Hull directly, instead of getting split between Hull and Shields. This means that even if you have full Shields you'll start taking damage directly to your Railjack if you leave a fire unattended. \nFixed loss of functionality when performing a Finisher while inside a Crewship when it explodes.\nFixes towards inability to use the Archwing Slingshot if two Client players spam the interaction at the same time during a Railjack mission.\nFixed a case where the End of Mission screen would pop in for a split second when transitioning from a Railjack mission to Dojo.\nFixed being able to launch Railjack missions from an incomplete Dry Dock (still in construction through Rising Tide) after Host migrating from a mission joined as Clients.\nThis also fixes a related issue of infinite loading tunnels when returning to Dojo after host migration. \nFixed Wreckage Capacity not immediately being updated until after exiting and then coming back after using Valence Fusion with Wreckage as one of the components.\nFixed Railjack Armament stats not displaying properly when viewing the full Railjack stats.\nFixed a loss of functionality when viewing the Nightwave screen when a squad member returns the Railjack to the Dry Dock.\nFixed some Railjack POIs having a delayed reaction to your presence (i.e not firing Super Weapon, firing Ram Sleds, etc),\nFixed being placed next to a POI (if there is one) when skipping the Crewship Archwing exit cutscene.\nFixed Railjack mesh collapsing when loading into Dry Dock after mission in the “Configure Railjack” panel.\nFixed a crash when aborting a Railjack mission after another player had also aborted.\nIncreased the Riven Capacity limit from 120 to 150.\nThe Blazing Step Ephemera has been removed from the Elite Sanctuary Onslaught rewards table and added to two places:\nArbitration Honors Store in the Relay\nRailjack Commander Boss Drop Tables (5%)\nOut of the growing list of Ephemeras, Blazing Step was the more difficult to obtain due to its drop rate within the Elite Sanctuary Onslaught table. By taking Blazing Step out of the ESO table, the rewards within ESO will normalize and fill in the missing 1.01%. You now have the option to either spend your Vitus Essence in the Arbitrations Honor Store or by bringing demise to Railjack Commanders during your Railjack missions. \nIncreased the amount of invested currency that is refunded for the following: \nDissolving ranked Mods refund more of the invested Endo (75% just like Rivens).\nScrapping ranked Avionics refund more of the invested Dirac (75% just like Mods).\nSelling ranked Mods refund more of the invested credits (75% just like Endo).\nThe Earth to Mars Junction now awards the Iron Phoenix Stance, and the Earth to Venus Junction now awards the Clashing Forest Stance.\nThis aims to provide new players an easier path to experience the Melee system at an early Star Chart stage. Those who have completed these Junctions will retroactively be given these Melee Stances. \nRemoved Copernics from Mining Nodes on the Orb Vallis and added to Eximus enemies in the Lua tileset.\nRemoved Pustrels from Mining Nodes in the Plains of Eidolon and added to Eximus enemies in the Infested Ship tileset.\nThe Rank Up FX for Warframes, Weapons, and Companions has been given a refresh! This FX also now applies your chosen Energy color instead of the default.\nShield Gating is now disabled in the Dojo Obstacle course when you hit intended insta-fail traps such as Kill or Laser Traps.\nUpdated the following Augment Mods to replace the terminology ‘Proc’ with ‘Status’:\nVexing Retaliation\nShocking Speed\nTidal Impunity\nNeutron Star\nHallowed Eruption\nPiercing Roar\nAdjusted icon for The Deadlock Protocol's promotional Glyph to represent the Corpus Founder more clearly, and have less of matching iconography with real life movements. \nThe Corpus Ship tileset remaster brings a new home for Razorback! Fight this Corpus creation in a brand new remastered Arena. Gameplay remains the same!\nReduced the hit FX of the Cernos Prime and Paris Prime.\nThe Opticor will now queue charging if you click+hold during its re-fire wait time (instead of ignoring your click if you didn't wait the full 1 second). \nTweaked some Fortuna hammering NPCs to be more in sync with each other.\nCorpus Ship Captura scenes “Freight” and “Maintenance” have been updated to the new remastered tileset, they are now “Artillery Battery Scene” and “Corpus Depository Scene”.\nPolished and tweaked Nagantaka's firing animation to reduce possible motion blur issues.\nChanged the Fortress Container codex entry to be \"Polished Storage Crate/Container\".\nPolished glass texturing to improve volumetrics, reflection simulation, and everything a good wall of glass should offer.\nOn the topic of glass, we have removed Reinforced Glass from its respective tilesets. \nSlight reduction to Elemental FX on Garuda’s Talons.\nImproved Companion Moa parkour movements when attempting to follow/catch up with its owner.\nKeep an eye out for new Venus skyboxes when loading into Venus missions and when gazing out your Orbiter windshield.\nUpdated the Arch-Gun animations (recoil smoothing etc.) when using Archwing Deployer in mission to make them even more awesome. \nAlso fixed an issue where players could slide around during the call down animation.\nThe Glaxion Vandal is now tradable.\nThe Kuva Bramma has received balance changes to address it’s overwhelming chart topping usage. The Kuva Bramma still goes boom, and we look forward to your feedback once you’ve given it a try.\nFull detail can be found here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1199010-kuva-bramma-changes-explanation-and-timeline/\nIt has a smaller reserve ammo (15 to 5), and gains fewer arrows from ammo pickups \nThis is to encourage players to aim the bow deliberately at crowds of enemies and not fire it wildly everywhere.\nFewer cluster bombs are produced on impact (from 7 to 3) \nReduces the overwhelming AOE potential somewhat but also makes the Bramma less visually busy. Players have said that the many many explosions produced by Bramma are hard to see through.\nIncreased cluster projectile radial attack size from 2.7m to 3.5m.\nReduced cluster projectile fall off from 100% to 50% \nFewer explosive fragments, but they cover more area and generally do more damage.\nUpdated the Kuva Bramnma description to include these changes:\nThis Grineer bow delivers vengeance in the form of cluster bomb-tipped arrows that can be detonated mid-air or on impact. Low quiver capacity, arrows are recovered singly.\nDamage increased from 180 to 248.\nStatus Chance increased from 30 to 36%.\nCritical Chance increased from 10 to 20%.\nMade some micro-optimizations to several UI panels.\nOptimized Crewship explosions in Railjack missions as they were causing a noticeable impact on performance. \nMade some micro-optimizations to run-time object creation.\nMade some systemic micro-optimizations to type serialization (level loading, run-time object creation, etc).\nOptimized level-loading slightly.\nFixed Railjack spot-loading the first time it's brought into view in the Orbiter.\nUpon falling/jumping off a platform in the Weave, you’ll now be teleported back to the main platform instead of failing the Weave. \nThe non-existent aim-gliding in the Weave was the root of many Weave failures, which is why we have added the teleport. It’s still the Glassmakers game though, so use your time wisely! \nThe amount of Cephalite Resonance to enter the Weave has been cut in half. The requirement is now 5 instead of 10.\nYour Cephalite Resonance count, as well as the amount required for the Weave, is now displayed upon hover on the Glassmaker crime scene episode selector. \nSlightly reduced the volume of Cephalite Tears opening/closing.\nFixed the ‘Friendly Fire’ Weekly Nightwave Act only awarding 1,000 instead of 4,500 Glassmaker Standing.\nUpon login, the outstanding 3,500 will be retroactively awarded to those who completed when it lacked the proper Standing reward.\nFixed Cephalite enemies having blown out FX if killed with a Fulmin.\nFixed parts of the Mod UI being cut in half if you loaded into a Relay/Town with the Nightwave screen open.\nFixed the “Elite Explorer” Nightwave Acts not showing progress in description.\n",

Now, in the above example, the Crouch/Slide/Roll action would trade places with the Power Menu action, resolving the conflict.\nFixed an issue where if you rebound Ability Menu under the General tab for controller bindings, it wouldn't update immediately under the Power Menu tab to that key, which could result in creating conflicting bindings under the Power Menu tab.\nFixed controllers using a higher deadzone value than desired for non-look analog inputs. Was applying a 20% deadzone across the board instead of using platform-specific values, which were generally lower. This should improve responsiveness of analog sticks.\nFixed an issue where resetting controller bindings would take effect immediately even if you chose not to save when it prompted you upon exiting. Now only takes effect upon confirmation when exiting.\nFixed the action list in the Customize Controller controller screen not updating to show the current working bindings as you're updating them.\nFixed a case where Corpus Mobile Defense objectives are invulnerable. As reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1194476-mobile-defense-satelittes-dont-take-damage/\nFixes towards Defense missions breaking due to an inability to terminate enemies that have been changed to Ally status (Nyx Mind Control, Revenant Enthrall, etc), thus inability to complete the Defense Wave.\nFixed Clients not seeing the dynamic Damage effects when the Defense Target's Health gets lower in tiles where the Target moves.\nFixed inability to gain Energy from Energy Restores after using Valkyr’s Hysteria.\nFixed Derim Zahn’s turrets never shutting off in The Index. \nFixed performing a Iron Phoenix Stance Heavy Attack (Middle Mouse Button by default) while sliding only triggering normal sliding attack, which also consumed combo count.\nFixed enemies/objects becoming stuck inside a catwalk in the Grineer Shipyard tileset, which could cause a progression stop.\nFixed Shield Gating mechanic being ignored by weapons that fire multiple projectiles at once for Clients. This resulted in some enemies shot by the Host will survive due to Shield Gating negating most of the damage, while enemies shot by the Client are not protected by the Shield Gate. \nFixed Mutalist Osprey Carrier’s ignoring Limbo’s Cataclysm bubble. \nFixed not receiving Credits for completing the first 2 Zones of Sanctuary Onslaught.\nFixed the \"Killing blow on x Sentients\" Riven challenge not counting for new Sentient enemies aboard the Sentient Anomaly. \nFixed the Archwing Launcher Segment Blueprint requiring Mastery Rank 5.

PLUS the Relic rewards from Ground Assault and Murex Raid missions have been replaced by these new Relics in Operation: Scarlet Spear. Check your in-game Codex for Relic drop locations!\nGet the newest Prime gear with Titania Prime Access and Prime Accessories here: https://www.warframe.com/prime-access\n\n\nReplaced Steel Meridian’s Sacrifice of Destreza Prime Handle with Redeemer Prime Blade.\nIf you already wield the power of these Primes or have their Relics in your Inventory, they will remain after the Vaulting.\nThe usual Riven Disposition changes that come with each new round of Prime Access is being held back until Consoles have been caught up to date with Operation: Scarlet Spear: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1178205-titania-prime-riven-disposition-update-plans/\n\nAdded a ‘Waiting for Satellite’ UI line when players are in the Murex Raid with their Oplinks down but have neglected to place the Satellite first. A few cases of ‘not receiving codes’ were a result of user error that this should fix. \nIncreased the Sentient AI count per player when Defending Oplinks in the Murex Raid mission.\nPreviously the number of spawns didn’t match up with how many players there were in the squad, and oftentimes there was nothing to Defend against. This should feel more to scale with the number of squadmates present. \nThe Flotilla Instance number now displays alongside the Flotilla progress at the center hologram of the Flotilla.\nMurex Raid Score is now shown in the mission UI just as it is in the Ground Assault mission.\nPlayers that have not completed the activation of their Railjack (via Reliquary Key) will no longer be allowed to Host the Murex Raid mission, due to conflicting objectives occurring while playing.\nPotential fix for players sometimes not uploading their scores, resulting in no placement on the Flotilla leaderboards and no rewards at the end of the Murex Wave.\nWe’ve also integrated some internal tracking to better determine the cause of this issue if it continues to happen.\nFixed Solo player squad mission status not being wiped when exiting mission to return to the Flotilla, which resulted in seeing your name in one of the active squads for a Ground/Murex mission.\nFixed a case of players ending up in Scarlet Spear Flotilla 0, even though they were invited to a different Flotilla.\nFixed a case of being in the incorrect Flotilla when inviting a player post Ground/Murex mission.\nThis could result in numerous issues such as not being connected to the Flotilla chat and inability to form a squad with a player from the same Flotilla.\nFixed the UI incorrectly stating that you were ‘Sending Kill Codes’ when an Oplink is deployed in a Murex Raid. It will now properly state that you’re ‘Awaiting Kill Codes’.\nPotential fix for having no objective when starting a Murex Raid.\nPotential fix for receiving a ‘Mission Failed’ screen during a Murex Raid if the Flotilla reached 100/100.\nFixed Little Duck’s Murex Wave Ending Inbox not indicating the difference between a successful versus failed Murex drive off.\nIn some cases this was causing confusion as to why Victory Payout was not being received, when in reality the Flotilla they participated in did not successfully meet the 100/100 goal. There are still cases where Victory Payout did not work, but this should mitigate confusion. \nFixed Flotilla Instance not appearing in Flotilla UI after returning from a Ground/Murex mission.\nFixed a game hitch every time you received a transmission during a Ground/Murex mission.\nWe’re still chasing some hitching transmissions but this fix should solve a good amount of them.\nFixed sometimes spot-loading Railjack cosmetics when loading into a Murex Raid.\nFixed Oplinks placed by a squadmate who has disconnected lingering perpetually.\nFixed objective marker disappearing for squadmates who haven’t caught up to the player who sped their way to the Condrix in the Ground Assault mission, leading to some players getting lost on their way to the Condrix.\nFixed Mag’s Crush ability forcing the Condrix to close.\nPotential fix for a back-to-back Host migration occurring due to the second Host attempting to catch up on rewards during the migration and thus migrating themselves. \nPotential fix for a Host migration resulting in the next Condrix not spawning in the Ground Assault mission.\nFixed the Basmu Alt Fire mode not healing on reload.\nFixed Venari’s Healing aura affecting the Oplink.\nThe Oplink is intended to not be affected by Abilities.\nFixed the Murex II and Murex III Emblems using the Condrix II and Condrix III icons when viewed in Inventory. \nFixed a script crash that could occur if you were standing on a Railjack exit while travelling between locations.\nFixed script error that could occur when warping in your Railjack\nFixed a script error that occurred when your Railjack had a Hull Breach.\nFixed a script error when placing your Oplink in the Ground Assault mission.\nFixed numerous script errors when exiting an enemy Crewship.\nRemoved Umbra Forma Blueprint from the Rare Crate drops due to a security issue. Nightwave Series 3: Glassmaker will bring back Umbra Forma as a reward, and we are looking at more secure places to include it back into the droptable. \nClarified the Split Flight Mod to include ‘Non-AOE Bows’ in the description.\nThis is to address that Split Flight cannot be equipped on the Lenz, Kuva Bramma, or Ivara’s Artemis Bow.\n",

  "changes": "Scarlet Spear: Hotfix 27.3.3:\nFixed inability to Trade.\nWe have changed the way Bonus Victory Payout is calculated to benefit all participating players in Murex Victories. Previously, your Victory Payout was determined by your Rank in the Flotilla (I, II, or III). Now, Victory Payout is calculated by your Best Higher Total Score between Ground or Space multiplied by 2 (capped at 10,000). 100/100 Murex Driven Away before the timer expires is still required to receive Victory Payout.\nAs an example \nif you earn 300 points in a Ground Assault in a Flotilla that drives the Murex away, you will earn 600 Scarlet Credits as a Victory Payout. \nAs another example \nif you earn 4,000 points in a Murex Raid in a Flotilla that drives the Murex away, you will earn 8,000 Scarlet Credits as a Victory Payout. \nThis aims to address some feedback we’ve been receiving about players who join a Flotilla in progress (ex 70/100 Murex Driven Away, etc) who aren’t able to reach a Rank in the Flotilla before it reaches 100/100 Murex Driven Away.\nA known issue that we’re aware of/investigating are the reports of receiving the wrong amount of Victory Payout respective to the Rank which is earned in the Flotilla. However, there are reports of players receiving the correct amount of Victory Payout, which is why we’re continuing to investigate the discrepancies. We have some fixes in the works that will be tested overnight before we submit for a Hotfix.\nWe have several other known issues we are investigating for Flotilla Kill Code upload progress and bug reports have been helpful in tracking down the issues.\nRailjack owners now have the option to either Host a Murex Raid with their own Railjack or Join another Murex Raid.\nSquads whose OpLinks are in good condition will now continue to show 'Scanning Kill Codes' as their status to avoid confusion (previously it could change from ‘Scanning Kill Codes’ to ‘Deploying OpLink’ if a healthy OpLink status was updated).\nYour Scarlet Spear Credit count will now display in Little Duck’s store UI similar to how Credits, Platinum, etc are displayed.\nFixed inability to invite other players in the same Flotilla to form a squad.\nFixes towards the Condrix not spawning once you reach the waypoint in the Ground mission.\nFixed scoring discrepancies if a Host migration occurred after the first Condrix in a Ground mission was completed:\nThe score does not increase at all for the next Condrix that is completed. \nThe 3rd Condrix is completed and the score only goes up by 5 for each Kill Code (as if this was the first Condrix to be completed).\nFixed Murex Raid Satellite waypoint not disappearing if a Host migration occurred after driving away the respective Murex.\nFixed a crash when trying to Host a session to rejoin a Scarlet Spear Flotilla.\nFixed a crash when the Aerolyst spawned.\nThis was a result of the Aerolyst instantly dying when spawned due to player AoE damage. The Aerolyst will now spawn invulnerable for 1 second to avoid this crash and give the poor guy a chance to wiggle his fingers at you!\nFixed Sentient Ramsleds not being removed after warping between Railjack missions.\nFixed a script error when Crewships are encountered in the Murex Raid.\nFixed a script error if Sentient Fighter reinforcements spawn just as the Satellite is destroyed in a Murex Raid.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed Heat Accretion stat comparison not working in the Railjack Configure panel.\nFixed a script error when encountering the Sentient Anomaly POI.\nFixed Ice Spring not having any textures with Deferred Rendering enabled.\nOptimized out a number small memory bloats in the type-dep database to reduce the risk of crashes due to relocation (player loadouts in relays, procedural levels, etc).\nFixed high GPU Effects time when shooting Profit Taker's legs with the Imperator Vandal.\nFixed a crash that could occur on slow internet connections if you quit the game while loading into a Relay.\nFixed a crash caused by mashing \"Launch Mission\" button while matchmaking service was already trying to find/Host/join a mission.\nFixed a crash when viewing Warframe Ability videos in the Arsenal.\nFixed several types of crashes that could occur when travelling to or from Towns, Relays or Dojos.\nFixed Operators not having correct body customizations/proportions.\nFixed certain Armor pieces not fitting correctly on Companions.\nFixed incorrect Energy color on the Nezha Yaksha Helmet.

This fix should also slightly improve performance!\nFixed Oplink state appearing as a filepath in the Flotilla squad labels above the Murex/Earth holograms.\nFixed a ghost of Flotilla players appearing in your Railjack upon starting a Murex Raid.\nFixed a script error that resulted in an inability to deploy an Oplink if one was previously destroyed in the mission.\nFixed a script error if the Railjack dies in a Murex Raid.\nFixed a script error in the Scarlet Spear Ground mission due to destroyed OpLink.\n",

The fight against the Sentient Threat has reached new heights \nand the Tenno will be using the new “Operation Link” aka OpLink! Ground teams and Space teams will be connected realtime using OpLink \nworking together to deter the Sentients!\nEligible Tenno will be presented with a brand new Cinematic detailing the state of the world as THE NEW WAR is waged.\n\nDuring your voyages into the unknown you will stumble across new Sentient enemies \nbe prepared!\nOnce again your favourite cross-armed lady, Little Duck, has taken her interest of Exotic Goods even further to aid you in Operation Scarlet Spear. Keep in mind that you won’t see all Arcanes in Little Duck's Trade Offerings \nwe'll be added those manually over time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those who have not logged in since before Warframe Revised, you will be presented with a welcome screen that now includes a direct shortcut to The New War Chapters to get you up to speed before you play Operation Scarlet Spear.\nWe’ve made a few changes to The New War Chapters section of the Codex:\nSelecting a completed New War Chapter will show the End of Quest screen.\nSelecting a New War Chapter in progress will show the Quest details like in the Codex.\nGas Effects will continue to tick radial Damage-over-Time for the average of the remaining Effect duration if their host dies. \nGas Status Area-of-Effect radius increases with the number of stacks, to a max of 10 stacks.\nRemoved Gas damage resistance from Toxic Ancient Auras.\nIncreased Hammer Shot Status Chance from 40% to 80%.\nIncreased Shattering Justice Status Chance from 20% to 90%.\nShattering Justice has also changed from being an additive rankup to a multiplicative rankup.\nIncreased Stunning Speed Status Chance from 10% to 30%.\nNo Status Effect will exceed a maximum of 4 stacks, with the exception of Impact which can stack up to 6 times.\nKeep in mind there is a cooldown to how quickly you can stack up Impact Status Effects to avoid stunlocking the Kuva Lich.\nRadiation does not change the enemy’s Faction, and instead of increasing Damage done to enemies with stacks, it increases the Damage taken from enemies who have turned on him/her.\nWe look forward to your constructive feedback and we work towards applying this to other Bosses/VIPS.\nFurther performance improvements towards Titania’s Lantern when cast on a large group of enemies. This particularly affected systems set to Low Particle Quality.\nImproved cache optimization to clean up even more space in the download cache.\nImproved world-state synchronization for Alerts, Sorties and other global events (there may have been up to a minute of desync).\nOptimized backdrop rendering performance in all levels.\nFixed Codex generation randomizing the block order of the Fragment entries (this should be deterministic to avoid updating several MB of resource for no reason).\nImproved game synchronization in hostile network environments.\nAdded Battle and Tactical Avionic categories in the Avionics Upgrade screen.\nCrewship boarding will be denied when the meltdown timer has 3 seconds remaining.\nThis is to avoid multiple issues with being put into a broken state due to the boarding cinematic competing with the Crewship exploding/attempting to teleport you out.\nRemoved the hanger door of the Grineer POI with the ‘Steal the Destroyer’ objective to resolve issues of the door not opening. When in doubt take it out!\nUpon returning back to the Railjack after exiting through the Archwing Cannon, you’ll now be spawned at the back of the Railjack bridge instead of near the Forging Bay.\nEnemies that you’re focused on while in a Turret will now display their Status Effect stacks.\nFixed Exo Skold Crewships in the Veil Proxima dropping Mk I Armaments. They will now drop MK III Armaments as intended.\nFixed the UI in the Super Weapon Platform not updating after the Radiator is destroyed for Clients.\nFixed inability to disengage bombs placed by Grineer Boarding Parties if a Host migration occurs during a Railjack mission.\nFixed incorrect Archwing movement animations if you exit the Railjack while Bullet Jumping (Moving left will play the forward animation, moving forward will play the moving right animation, etc).\nFixed a bug where the screenshake from a Grineer Crewship reactor meltdown would linger forever if it was active when the Crewship exploded.\nFixed Grineer fighters attacking the Derelict POI in Veil Proxima missions.\nFixed Vidar Reactors Mk III missing their component modifiers. As reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1172940-vidar-reactors-mk3-lost-their-component-modifiers-fix-pending/\nFixed Tactical Menu not displaying correct Battle Avionic values that have had their Grid Upgraded in the Dry Dock.\nFixed case of  Crewships sometimes staying completely still.\nFixed seeing black boxes when in Turret AR mode.\nFixed Railjack fighters sometimes going out of level bounds while in combat.\nFixed the ‘Forge All’ button having no effect or sound. \nFixed having to click the ‘Railjack Crew’ button twice when selecting it from Dojo Navigation.\nFixed Railjack name text lingering behind when joining another player’s squad and loading into their Dry Dock.\nFixed missing looping sounds for Ramsleds in the Saturn Proxima and Veil Proxima.\nFixed a script error when casting the Railjack Void Hole ability.\nAs per player request, we’ve reduced Forma, Orokin Catalyst, Orokin Reactor, and Exilus Warframe Adapter build time to 23 hours so that 1 can be built consistently every day.\nWe are making changes to Magus Lockdown due to it being virtually one of the best CC and Damage combinations in the game. In some cases you can clear waves of Elite Sanctuary Onslaught without even using a Warframe or Weapon, and simply spam Magus Lockdown to victory. This goes well beyond the intended use of it and we are changing it to a CC only Arcane \ntrue to its name \nMagus Lockdown!\nMagus Lockdown will no longer apply Puncture damage to tethered enemies.\nThe amount of active Tethers is now limited to 2 per player. \nFor example, Void Dash once > one Tether, Void Dash again > 2nd Tether, Void Dash a 3rd time > 3rd Tether, 1st Tether dies etc..\nMagus Lockdown no longer affects the Golden Maw due to the Arcane killing the Maw and preventing Quest completion. \nThis also fixes a script error when Magus Lockdown activates while encountering a Golden Maw.\nGrendel’s Nourish now mimic’s Titania’s Tribute buff selector.\nIf you’re unfamiliar with Titania’s Tribute buff selector, this means that Nourish is a tap to cycle/select buff and hold to cast. This is a reverse of how it functioned prior to this Update.\nWhen consumed by Grendel, Sentients now have a max duration they can be consumed before popping out that is affected by diminishing returns.\nThis change was made to prevent Grendel from prog stopping missions where all Sentients must be exterminated for the mission to succeed. \nGrendel can now consume Grenades \ncause why not!\nTitania has a new Passive: Titania generates Health for herself and nearby Allies every time she casts an Ability (4hp/second for 20 seconds)! The personal Titania Parkour Boost is staying, just the communal Trampoline isn't.\nTitania can now use Blink while in her Razorwing ability!\nFixed casting Titania’s Razorwing right as you fall into a teleport volume in the Simulacrum resulting in an infinite white screen.\nUpdated the Arcane ‘DISTILL’ term to ‘BREAK DOWN’ to acquaint new Arcane Management mechanics.\nAdded tips to the Arcane screen for ‘BREAK DOWN’, Arcanes that refresh, and how to obtain respective Arcanes. \nArcanes are now displayed with their respective Icon in the HUD, instead of the generic Arcane icon.\nThe Rank-Up callout is now displayed to the left of the next Arcane Rank in the Arcane Upgrade screen when using a controller.\n \nArcanes that are sold in Vendor Offerings will now only show Max Rank tooltip information, and UI indication that the Arcane you’re purchasing is Unranked. \nThis fixes Arcane tooltips expanding off screen when viewed in Vendor Offerings. \nClarified Arcane requirements for Arcane Trickery, Arcane Ultimatum, and Exodia Might by adding ‘Kill’ to the ‘On Finisher’ line.\nIncreased Status Chance for the Gunblade type weapons to match new Shotgun Status Chance values.\nMade Fall Off changes to the following weapons:\nRedeemer \nFall Off increased from 20-40m to 10-20m.\nRedeemer Prime\nFall Off increased from 20-40m to 10-30m.\nThe Rakta Dark Dagger Shield bonus when damaging an enemy afflicted by Radiation is now only granted if you have Shields.\nAtlas’ Immovable Passive now also applies to Staggers.\nAdded support for Bosses to display active Status Effects on their special Health bar.\nRemoved Stealth Melee bonus always applying to Simulacrum enemies when ‘Pause AI’ is enabled, thus giving non authentic numbers when testing Loadouts. \nThe Warframe Upgrade Arsenal stats now display Resistance values granted by Mods:\n \nMade spawn changes to improve flow of enemies in the Lua Survival tileset.\nRemoved knockdown from Elite Shield Lancer grenades.\nCharging weapons, like the Staticor, previously only showed Charged Attack Damage in the Arsenal stats, we now additionally show Quick Shot Damage values below the Charged Attack stats.\nYou will no longer receive Ghoul Threat Inbox messages due to their redundancy. \nEnemies inside Void Fissure Spy vaults that are not engaged in combat will no longer become Corrupted. \nThis fixes enemies in Void Fissure Spy vaults setting off alarms when becoming Corrupted.\n",

  "changes": "Empyrean: Kuva Lich Changes 27.1.0:\n\nThe birth of the very first Kuva Lich came just over 3 months ago (October 31 2019)! A copious amount of Additions, Changes, and Fixes have been made in these 3 months; each one of them touching the surface of feedback, but not fully reaching all the way into the depths. Today, that changes!\nIf you watched Devstream #136, the 2019 Player Survey showed us that out of the 27,000+ responses, the Kuva Lich system was the 2019 addition that was enjoyed the least. Many players voiced that the Kuva Lich system got progressively less fun the more time and energy was devoted to it. While finding the line between repetition and progress is one Warframe has struggled with since it’s first day, Liches highlighted some issues we aim to address while walking that line.\nA downed Kuva Larvling will now display an icon of the Kuva weapon that it’s birthed Kuva Lich will possess!\nThis allows players to decide upfront if they want to pursue that weapon by finishing the downed Kuva Larvling, or to ignore and attempt another Lich. The Kuva Larvling will be in this downed state for a max of 30 seconds before it perishes.\n\nYour Kuva Lich will no longer kill you when you fail a Requiem guess, nor will they attempt to break your back. The Parazon stabbing animation will play but the UI will show whether it was a success or failure. Upon receiving a Requiem fail, your Kuva Lich will laugh at you and leave, leaving your back and dignity intact!\n\nYour Kuva weapon duplicates now offer a gradual progression towards a “perfect” Kuva weapon, which would reflect a 60% damage value, if you choose to pursue this path.\nWe’re also looking at other places we could potentially use this mechanic (Railjack, etc)!\nAs you can see, we’ve cracked a few eggs to make this omelette! We look forward to your feedback on these Kuva Lich changes!\n\n\nIncreased Converted Kuva Lich minimum time to 2 minutes.\nIncreased Converted Kuva Lich Damage Per Second with damage bonus upgrade 3x.\nFixed Converted Kuva Liches not using their abilities.\nDoubled the chance of a Kuva Lich to have a Vengeful Ephemera from 10% to 20%!\nKnown Requiem/attempts now also appear in your Parazon Upgrade screen!\nChanged all Kuva Thrall markers to consistently reflect the new icon brought in 27.0.11. This includes the minimap and when waypointing a Kuva Thrall.\nKuva pickup/rewards are now displayed as the fancy banner UI, similar to Argon.\nKuva Liches can no longer be Parazon stabbed as they are escaping. This resulted in invisible animations, and the UI unveiling if your Requiem Mod guess was correct but not registering it, thus not ranking up your Kuva Lich.\nCleaned up visual metal chunks from the Kuva Liches Carapace (Iron Skin) ability.\nYou can now search the Kuva Lich History Codex section by name, Kuva weapon, and Ephemera.\nFixed Lich ‘Ruse’ clones displaying the default Excalibur Helmet on their shoulder instead of the same Warframe Helmet as their owner. \nFixed Nidus Helmet Armor not appearing grayscale on Kuva Liches.\nFixed certain enemy types being allowed to be spawned as Kuva Thralls that shouldn't be.\nFixed cases of the Kuva Lich ping-ponging between locations when engaging its target.\nFixed script error when changing resolution while in the Kuva Lich screen.\n\n\n\n\nA note from our Sound Team: “We recorded many different real guitars to make this electric guitar Shawzin sound heavy.  The sounds are a result of blending these different guitar tones together. Each of the notes has a couple of different variations so when you play it, it will sound like a realistic electric guitar.”\nOmni tool is now available as a Gear item in your Inventory (Archwing Quest completion required)! This allows you to place the Omni tool in your preferred Gear spot for quick access!\nIf you forget to equip the Omni tool in your Gear upon entering a Railjack mission it will still be given to you for the mission.\nIncreased maximum power for Zekti Predator Avionic to 80%, from 72%\nThis Avionic was slightly under-performing its cheaper Vidar equivalent.\n‘Show Equipped’ will now show ranked Avionics that are equipped even when ‘Show Ranked’ is disabled.\nHijacked Crewships now start the reactor meltdown sequence when they reach zero health.\nOrdnance weapon icons now become translucent while in cooldown, and will reflect a timer icon to better indicate it’s current cooldown state.\nChanged Railjack Engine Component rating stats from Kilometers Per Hour to Meters Per Second to be consistent in the equipped stats.\nFixed Railjack Speed stat showing a higher number than your in-game movement speed.\nThis fix needs some explanation. First of all, a bit of trivia, Railjack operates at a different scale than the rest of Warframe. Perhaps some of you have seen space-time breaking down in the form of truly enormous cats... The Speed that was being shown in the drydock in your ship Stats was in the wrong scale and gave numbers that were inaccurate.  This also caused the bonus given by your engine, displayed in kilometers-per-hour, to be wrong: an engine might say that it gave an extra 30km per hour, but give far far more than that in the Stats if you did the math to convert.  This has been fixed so that: 1) your Stats now show the correct Speed for Railjack's world scale, and, 2) your engines are rated in meters per second which matches up to the Stats.  While it may look like your ship's Speed stat in the drydock has gone down significantly, please try flying around in missions and see how your ship handles. This only fixes how the UI reports the numbers in your Stats. No change to how fast your ship actually moves is intended, and if your ship doesn't fly at the meters-per-second shown in the Stats then it should be carefully measured and reported as a bug.\nFixed the Railjack Forward Artillery not damaging Crewships past their engines. You should find that the Forward Artillery hits harder and your shot isn’t wasted on just destroying the Crewship engines! \nFixed Crewships not recovering after becoming disabled by your Railjack guns.\nFixed Railjack Host being able to use Navigation before the mission is complete and Clients inability to use Navigation at all when launched from the Dry Dock.\nFor clarification, the correct functionality is Host and Client can use Railjack Navigation after mission complete and neither can use Navigation before mission complete.\nFixed enemy Captains spawning in the “Asteroid Base Commander” POI and Commanders spawning in the \"Kill the Galleon Captain\" POI.\nFixed Galvarc Missile Launcher not functioning for Clients.\nFixed Fiery Phoenix not becoming disabled when Flux Energy reaches 0.\nFixed full ranked Flow Burn not being upgraded further when placed into a max rank Grid.\nFixed Battle Avionics remaining disabled for Clients after Railjack is repaired from Critical Breach.\nFixed Dome Charges being consumed when a Client enters the Forward Artillery, regardless of actually firing the BFG.\nFixed issue where Clients would see Forward Artillery reload multiple times while waiting for Host to put Dome Charges in the weapon.\nFixed Clients not seeing Shatter Burst Battle Avionic explosion FX.\nFixed Clients not seeing the missile created by Shatter Burst/Void Hole.\nFixed being left out in space if you were aboard a Crewship when it despawns due to mission completion. \nFixed cases of losing the Railjack Forge UI if you attempted to activate it while sliding.\nFixed Railjack Ammunition and supplies that were spent during a mission not saving at the end of mission.\nFixed losing custom Railjack Skin/Colors if a Host migration occurred and you were the last remaining player. \nFixed Railjack Avionic/Salvage pickups sometimes not showing distance markers.\nFixed the camera breaking when Warping to another player while in the Archwing Slingshot.\nFixed Tactical Menu Chase Camera to better reflect the view of the player’s camera.\nFixed Dry Dock creating a blocking volume in a room that is built below it.\nFixed issues with selecting Veil/Saturn Proxima nodes when using the controller.\nFixed cooldown bar on Railjack Ordnance burst-fire weapons emptying and not start filling until after the laser's done firing, instead of when you initially fire.\nFixed Railjack Tactical Avionics cooldown tooltip information not applying Intrinsic cooldown reductions from Tactical Response and Swift Tactics.\nFixed Void Cloak cooldown timer not updating when viewing in the Tactical Menu.\nFixed Upgraded Avionics not showing their proper description and stats, such as being Ranked vs Unranked.\nOptimizations for the Kuva Fortress tileset. This includes cleaning up wasteful materials, abusive lighting, volumetrics, overdrawn meshes and much more. More optimizations to come!\n \nMade micro-optimizations to a script used in Survival missions.\nImproved performance of the Railjack cannons.\nImproved performance when using the Imperator Vandal in Railjack.\nOptimized runtime lighting in an Earth cave tile.\nOptimized real time lighting in the Jupiter Gas City Index tileset.\nOptimized the Omni tool to fix a hitch when equipping it.\nMade micro-optimizations to a script used for controlling doors. \nMade some micro-optimizations to HUD performance, especially on Railjack.\nMade a micro-optimization to UI performance, including while piloting the Railjack.\nMade a micro-optimization Railjack POI once sub-objectives have been completed.\nMade a micro-optimization to a script that handles fire breaking out on a Railjack.\nMade a micro-optimization to Chroma's Effigy ability.\nMade a micro-optimization to a script used to animate the Dual Kamas.\nMelee Heavy Attacks are no longer able to be triggered by holding 'E', they again live exclusively on Alt-Fire.\nThe loss of Melee Combo Counter feedback due to spamming Melee drove the vast amounts of requests for Melee Heavy Attack to not be holding ‘E’. A toggle for Melee Heavy Attacks is not in the cards, thus Melee Heavy Attacks are now essentially brought back to its original mechanic of having to use Alt-Fire. \nNPCs now have about a second of delay before being able to perceive other players or NPCs that come out of invisibility, regardless of alert state. Previously, combat-state enemies would near instantly retarget in such cases. Seen in:\nRemoved Riven Mods from the Codex Mod section.\nThere were a few issues present here: 1) the Codex Mod section not display all of your Rivens Mods, and, 2) the Riven Mods that it did show would point their acquisition to Cephalon Simaris, which only applies to Companion Weapon Rivens.

  "changes": "Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.9:\nArmor value changes:\nFlak: 300 to 150\nElite Flak: 350 to 175\nTaktis: 250 to 125\nElite Taktis: 350 to 175\nCutter: 250 to 125\nElite Cutter: 300 to 150\nOutrider: 800 to 300\nElite Outrider: 800 to 400\nHealth value changes:\nFlak health: 250 to 375\nTaktis health: 200 to 300\nCutter health: 200 to 300\nOur intent is to make Railjack weapons more effective on their own. As such, Rhino’s Roar and Saryn’s Toxic Lash no longer unintentionally affect Railjack weapons, as per [DE]Marcus’ post here:\n\nElite Exo Taktis\nElite Kosma Cutter\nElite Gyre Cutter\nElite Exo Taktis\nElite Exo Flak\nElite Exo Cutter\nElite Exo Flak\nElite Exo Cutter\nElite Exo Flak \nAdding Void Hole to Elite Exo Flaks should make it significantly easier to acquire due to their spawn rates, but we will continue to watch all the drops in case they need further changes.\nElite Exo Cutter\nDecreased the effectiveness of the Particle proc but increased its Duration\nReduced to 7.5% damage bonus per hit, still stacks, and lasts 20 seconds. The exponential growth and short duration meant this was far more beneficial to rapid-fire guns than anything else.\nIncreased the effectiveness of the Incendiary proc but decreased its Duration\nDouble the damage per tick but half the duration; same total damage but in less time to feel more relevant.\nPulsar series\nIncreased base damage\nIncreased fall off range\nThese extremely precise weapons were having trouble competing with the other options available. Increased damage by about 10% and increased effective range should help give them a more viable role.\nPhotor series\nIncreased fall off range\nExtra range and these also benefit indirectly from the improvement to Incendiary status.\nCryophon series\nReduced damage and increased fall off range\nReducing the armor values of enemies made these capable of killing every enemy in a single hit, this brings them back in line with the intended time to kill. Please bear in mind we are actively watching player stats and collecting feedback, and are willing to iterate on balance. \nZetki House\nReduced Heat Accretion for all Zetki weapon variants apart from Cryophon\nThis house trades more heat for more damage, but it felt like they were TOO hot for the amount of extra damage you got.  Compared to the baseline weapons, Zetki now offers 50% more damage for double heat instead of quadruple heat.\nPermanent in-world markers have been added to Avionics and Salvage in Railjack when they drop.\nThis will allow you to always know what remains on the field of battle, and how to navigate accordingly. Adding awareness to the important loot has been a huge request, and this visibility increase should make sure no loot is left behind. Aside, we are reviewing ‘vacuum’ range. \nAsterite Resource pickups now reward 2x as much Asterite. \nAsterite costs for Wreckage were going a bit too slowly, so now you will earn it at twice the rate. \nYour Squad Overlay is now visible when in various Railjack modes (Pilot, Weapon, etc).\nThere’s been consistent expression that ‘seeing my Squad’s status’ is important. We have now ensured it’s visible when piloting / gunning / etc, and we have added some new iconography to show player states. \nAdded ‘Squad Status’ for Railjack Missions in the Squad Overlay. \nThese Icons show what your squadmates are doing, including: pilot, gunner, cannon, Omni Tool, Archwing, at a point of interest, engineering, fighting a boarding team, in slingshot, in Crewship, or just messing around on the Railjack doing nothing specific. \nIntrinsic points can no longer be gained once all available Intrinsics are maxed out. If you are already above the maximum, your additional points have not been lost. \nRailjack minimap is now always fully visible.\nBetter centered the Railjack Pilot HUD diamond. \nAdded new force feedback to all Weapons and Missile Launchers. \nOff-screen space enemy markers in Archwing now show awareness state fill.\nFixed some color and alpha settings on off-screen markers in Archwing for better visibility.\nIncreased brightness and thickness of enemy markers in Railjack. \nUpdated the Railjack name placement on all Skins to be better visible.\nSet the maximum length for Railjack Names to 50 characters \nin practice, this is almost an increase. The limit before was set by width along the available real estate. Now we have properly conforming names. . \nOptimized camera placements overall when customizing Railjack / viewing aspects. \nThe ‘Toggle Interior’ button now has a checkbox to indicate active state. \nRailjack Health and Shield now show when they are invulnerable (i.e after a Catastrophic Failure Breach). \nRemoved HUD markers from missiles launched by Seeker Volley battle avionic, which also fixed enemy HUD markers disappearing. \nThe player’s view of a Cloaked Railjack (using Void Cloak) is now a more obvious effect.\nRailjack name shows in ‘edit name’ input box.\nRailjack name shows in HUD instead of generic ‘Railjack’. \nCargo consoles now show a small effect when they are busy and unavailable to use. \nController ‘start’ button now closes tactical menu instead of opening top menu.\nSlightly zoomed out the tactical map when on the railjack, increased visibility of minimap features.\nSorting for Drain will now sort higher Drain to the top.\nAdded Wreckage count to equip screen.\nFixed Engines Colour customization not working properly. \nFixed an issue with Railjack stats appearing as the default one when pressing ESC on any part of Components menu.\nFixed missing sounds on a certain Archwing fly-in cinematic. \nFixed a script error in the Tactical Map. \nFixed erroneous ‘Stealth’ component from Railjack gun Huds. \nFixed Arrows for Railjack markers pointing the wrong way when you have a scaled HUD. \nFixed Nekros’ Shadows of the Dead spawning enemy ships inside Railjacks (lol). \nFixed an issue where using the Archwing Slingshot with Melee equipped causes issues. \nFixed an issue where you could use menus while in Archwing Slingshot. \nFixed the ‘Hijacked’ Grineer Crewship spawning inside geometry. \nFixed multiple [HC] tags appearing. \nFixed an issue where players entering Grineer Ramsleds could travel unknown places. \nFixed Ivara’s Zipline persisting when in Railjack Emplacements. \nFixed Railjack audio looping when in Landing Craft. \nFixed the Reliquary Void Branches not persisting. \nFixed Ballistic and Particle damage icons being swapped in-game. \nFixed Railjack Slingshot FX colour not updating properly. \nFixed Railjack Weaponry appearing at odd angles for Clients when dismounting. \nFixed Clients being permanently dead in Railjacks if they return to a Dojo in the ‘Revive’ screen. \nFixed Tactical views of players on Railjack Weaponry not working correctly. \nFixed overlapping music on mission complete. \nFixed being able to acquire Revolite by methods other than crafting / preparing Payloads.\nFixed Archwing death causing players to respawn at the beginning of the mission.\nFixed Omni tool equip animation causing loss of functionality when mounting emplacements/piloting.\nFixed Omni Tool having an ammo type (which didn’t actually interact with anything).\nFixed multiple crashes that could occur when loading into a mission as a client in a Landing Craft.   \nFixed Omni Tool showing level ‘0’.\nFixed being able to exit an emplacement without animations instantly by spamming esc multiple times.\nFixed railjack mission complete popup rendering behind the railjack HUD.\nFixed grineer Crewship console disabling the shield when exiting the hack without completing.\nFixed Crewship healing bubble not being seen or affected by clients.\nFixed Sigma Engines displaying incorrect stats.\nFixed some weapons showing incorrect icons.\nFixed railjack engineering 10 intrinsic not working for clients.\nFixed the repair drones not disappearing if someone else repairs the malfunction before the drones finish it.\nFixed drifting sound stopping properly when pilot leaves pilot seat during drifting.\nFixed bug where Intrinsics could be kept on mission abort, which was never intended.\nFixed Archwing bug that would cause Clients to be stuck with normal weapons if they slingshot into a non-Crewship enemy.\n",

  "changes": "Rising Tide: Update 26.1:\n\nThe balance of power is tipping.  An imminent threat grows stronger, surging across the Origin System. Will you stand against it? Keep pace in the arms race by starting construction on your Clan’s Dry Dock!\nBuild the Dry Dock, assemble your Railjack and prepare for the coming battle. What will begin as a hangar will evolve into your sanctuary, a space to hone and upgrade your ship with powerful technology to become the weapon you’ll need. Build the Dry Dock by rallying your clan and contributing Resources to its construction. After that, if you have completed the Second Dream Quest, start the Rising Tide Quest to begin forging your Railjack.\n\n\nThe Grineer threat is mounting and you must rise to meet it. Track down the pieces of a long destroyed Railjack and breathe new life into it with the help of the newest Cephalon, Cy!\nTime has not been kind to the Railjacks. You’ll need to work with Cephalon Cy to find viable salvage from wreckage across the Origin System. After Cephalon Cy is installed in the Dry Dock, locate the six necessary Railjack components, retrieve them, then return back to the Dry Dock to restore them to glory. Once your Railjack is rebuilt, you’ll be able to board and explore your ship. Ignition and flight command requires additional components, which have yet to be located by Cephalon Cy.\nThis update previews new Resources for future update EMPYREAN! When Empyrean launches, a wide variety of Railjack Specific resources will launch in missions, but we are previewing 4 new Resources early to aid in the construction of your Railjack:\nEximus Units will Drop 2 of the new Resources:\nCubic Diodes = Eximus units on *Europa Ice Planet tileset\nCarbides = Eximus units on *Ceres Shipyard tileset\n*We've added clarification that the Shipyard tileset on Ceres and Europa Ice Planet tileset on Europa are the nodes that will yield these new Resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoubled the amount of Critical Chance on Melee Rivens and gave the Critical Chance 2x for Heavy Melee.\nAmalgam Ripkas changed to 187% Critical Chance (x2 for Heavy Attacks).\nTrue Punishment changed to 100% Additional Combo Count Chance, -50% Combo Duration.\nRank 1, 2, 3, and 4 Liches now drop Kuva for all squad members when a Parazon is used on them \nwhether that leads to defeat or ranking up, the Kuva is yours on Ranks 1 through 4! You will recall there was a brief window where Thralls could drop Kuva or a Requiem Relic. We removed the Kuva, and are now applying it to Liches. Kuva numbers are balanced against Siphons / Kuva Survival missions, and take into account the fact that multiple Liches spawn in missions. The aim is to not make this the best Kuva run, just an added value. Siphons and other missions are meant to be the optimal path. Rank 5 Liches do not have Kuva as a drop as they could intentionally be kept alive for a vector to acquire Kuva. The Drops are: Rank 1: 150, Rank 2:  200, Rank 3: 250, Rank 4: 300. This is lower than some other discussed numbers because we are now letting it share across Squadmates. \nLiches now run away (but don’t rank up) if you’ve downed them 3 times, but don’t use your Parazon on them. This allows you to overpower your Lich and have it flee, instead of having the only way to remove it from a Mission be your failure to know a Requiem.\n\nOperators can no longer perform Mercy kills on Larvling or Kuva Lich. Your Warframe is armed with the Parazon for a reason!\nMore fixes towards Requiem Mod UI lingering on the screen perpetually after failing to Parazon stab the Kuva Lich.\nFixed issue with Requiem Mod UI lingering and not updating properly after performing a Mercy on Kuva Lich as Wisp.\nFixed Kuva Lich despawning after getting downed while temporarily friendly from Revenant's Enthrall.\nFixed issues with the Vanquish / Convert context action appearing on Kuva Liches for Clients.\nFixed Kuva Lich weapons showing as fully Mastered in player Profile before hitting rank 40. Affected accounts should now see the corrected Mastered status based on progress.\nFixed Kuva Lich weapons not being localized in the End Of Mission results screen if you abort or look at last mission results.\nFixed Kuva Lich screen overlapping with the Market UI if the Market is opened while viewing said Kuva Lich screen.\nARCH LINE has replaced Itzal’s Blink ability:Launch a tethered hook that either pulls enemies close, or pulls the Warframe towards any stationary objects it hooks onto.\nImproved handling of alt-tab when fullscreen, particularly when using the experimental flip-mode optimizations. Please try it again if you had problems before! Please note that there are known issues with Experimental Optimized Flip-Mode when using on cloned displays.\nMade the optimized flip-model work if you booted up in native fullscreen before switching to borderless or windowed.\nImproved diagnostics for GPU-driver crashes (we now send you to the website for help).\nOptimized batch removal of friends to reduce server load.\nMade some micro-optimizations to screens with a button-bar.\nMade some micro-optimizations to the categorized grid UI.\nMade some micro-optimizations to the Mod and Upgrade screens.\nMade some micro-optimizations to certain UI scripts.\nMade some micro-optimizations to sorting Mods by \"recent\".\nAdded a projectile explosion range FX to Garuda’s Dread Mirror blood projectile for the local player (one doing the casting) so you can see your output.\nSlight trim to the Bloodletting cast animation.\nBloodletting now gives 35% Energy instead of 25%.\nReduced Seeking Talons charge time by around 15%.\nIncreased Seeking Talons Status Chance from 50 to 75%.\nFixed motion blur on Garuda's Dread Mirror.\nIncreased maximum Dojo Room capacity from 100 to 128 to accommodate for the new Crimson Branch and Dry Dock additions!\nAdded a new Captura Orbiter Scene so you can finally take a family photo with you and your 99 Domestik Drones \nnow with a new skylight!\nWe now allow the use of Skins on Zaws \nthis 2 year old request is finally seeing the light of day after some under-the-hood restructuring. If you come across any issues with Exodia, or odd behaviours, please let us know! Skin compatibility is automatically determined by Strike! \nRestored Mirage’s Eclipse granting its ‘light’ buff when Mirage is on fire AND when under the effect of an Electricity Status Effect.\nCapatilized Ember’s name in her Inferno ability description.\n",

But eventually even maggots can fly.\nUpdate 26 brings a completely new breed of enemy, gameplay, and reward: The Kuva Liches have arrived. This system is what the Kingpin system, first shown on Devstream #88, has become over time, despite being put on hold for quite some time! This will continue to be expanded throughout Warframe’s factions and will be expanded to include a Clan aspect in a future update.\nCIPHER MODS \nThink of these as upgrading the tool aspect of ‘hacking’. These make hacking easier or give small benefits when hack is completed successfully!\nIntruder: + Additional Seconds to hacking. \nLive Wire: Shock Enemies within 24 meters while hacking.  \nAuto Breach: 30% Chance to autohack! \nRuntime: +45% Sprint Speed after hack.\nMaster Key: Unlock nearby lockers after hacking\nUntraceable: Become invisible for 18s after hacking. \nFailsafe: 50% Chance to retry a failed hack.\nASSASSIN MODS \nThese are for the new PARAZON ‘MERCY’ FINISHERS that can occur at anytime in game on eligible enemies.\nBlood for Life: 50% chance to create a Health Orb on Mercy.\nBlood for Energy: 50% chance to create an Energy Orb on Mercy.\nBlood for Ammo: Mercy refills magazine by 100%\nHit and Rune: On Mercy: +60% Parkour speed for 6 seconds\nOut Of Sight: Blind Enemies with 18 meters on ‘Mercy’ kill.\n\n\n\n\nNew Requiem Mods have arrived and they are the only way to end your Kuva Lich. Your Lich is immortal until you figure out the correct combination of Requiem Mods \nthe precise order matters, and the only way to glean the order is by seeking ‘Requiem Whispers’ from your Lich’s Thralls and trying them out on you Lich.\nThe 8 Requiem Mods are:\nLOHK\nFrom brooding gulfs are we beheld\nBy that which bears no name\n\nXATA\nIts heralds are the stars it fells\nThe sky and Earth aflame\n\nJAHU\nCorporeal laws are unwrit\nAs suns and love retreat\nVOME\nTo cosmic madness laws submit\nThough stalwart minds entreat\nRIS\nIn luminous space blackened stars\nThey gaze, accuse, deny\nFASS\nRoiling, moaning, this realm of ours\nIn madness lost shall die\nNETRA\nCarrion hordes trill their profane\nAccord with eldritch plans\nKHRA\nTo cosmic forms from tangent planes\nWe end as we began\nRequiem Relics also contain an all new item \na Riven Sliver! A fragment of a sundered Riven. It is known that, with enough Slivers, Palladino is capable of reforging a complete Riven.\n\n\nThe Void is reacting to the Lich experiments on the Kuva Fortress, and for the first time: Void Fissures are appearing on the Kuva Fortress! But these are unlike the others, and they only respond to REQUIEM RELICS.\nThere are 4 Requiem Relics \neach with 2 Requiem Mods. Collect them all!\n\nYou can get Requiem Relics from KUVA FLOOD SIPHON MISSIONS, guaranteed.\n\nYou can get Requiem Relics from normal KUVA SIPHON MISSIONS, 30% of the time.\n\nThese can be refined like Lith, Meso, Neo, and Axi Relics. A 5th Tab has been added for REQUIEM RELICS in your Void Relic Refinement screen.\nRequiem Mods have a limited amount of charges (3), and consume charges when you successfully kill or convert a Lich. Repeat Requiem Mods in your collection will eventually go to good use.\n\n\nYou can only have one Lich active at a time.\n\nThe only way to get rid of your Lich is by using your Parazon with the correct Requiem Mods in the correct order \nbut you won’t be able to do this until you’ve found your Lich. Read on to learn how to do that.\n\nClearing Nodes and Killing Thralls leads to progression toward revealing your Lich’s 3 fatal Requiem Mods.\n\nOnce you know the 3 Mods, figuring out the Order is a matter of trial and error in battles against your Lich \ngood luck!\n\nYour Liches likelihood to hunt you down is indicated by a bar on your Lich menu. The angrier they are, the more likely to spawn. Once you’ve drawn your Lich out to fight by destroying their Thralls and Influence nodes, fights against your LICH can go one of two ways:\nDEFEAT\nif your Parazon does not have the proper order of Requiem Mods. You will be defeated, and your Lich escapes, and grows stronger.\nVICTORY \nif your Parazon does have the proper order of Requiem Mods. You will be victorious. \nTHE VICTORY!\nDefeating your Lich gives you two options:\nConverting your Lich with your Parazon corrupts it and turns it to your side, and will have a chance to appear in battle to aid you.\n\n\nWhen you Vanquish a Lich, you’ll get its Kuva Weapon variant that is completely unique to your Lich. The base weapons are as follows, with custom stats depending on your Lich:\n\n\nIf Kuva Weapons or Lifelong Companionship aren’t your thing, there’s more! The birth of a Kuva Lich from a Larvling has a chance to create a Lich with some added flair \none of Seven new Ephemeras that you can only earn from Vanquishing or Converting your Lich (if it has one equipped)! These are a bit more special and rare, so don’t expect every Lich to have one, but we will be balancing over time.\nBrand new Market items are available to help jump-start your Kuva world domination if that’s the road you wish to take. As with all our Platinum priced Market goods, these Packs are geared towards attaining convenience, at which they are priced accordingly:\nA Bundle featuring new Mods for your Parazon that give perks to Hacking or performing ‘Mercy’ kills on enemies. Purchased Mods are unranked.\n4 Radiant Requiem Relics, one of each type, I, II, III,and IV.\nGet a taste of the Old Blood with this exclusive, one-time purchase, of Kuva Lich items. Includes a full set of Requiem Mods, the Radiant Requiem Relic Pack, Kuva Warframe Armor, and an assortment of Kuva Lich themed color pallets.\n\n\n\nEach enemy consumed grants 50 bonus Armor.\nSwallow an enemy whole and store it in Grendel’s gut. Not satisfied? Keep eating, but beware, each foe in Grendel’s belly slowly consumes Energy. Hold to vomit out stored enemies covering them in toxic bile.\nConsume the enemies in Grendel’s gut and nourish nearby squad members with a radial buff.\nViolently puke out a bile soaked enemy from Grendel’s gut, turning the unfortunate creature into a toxic projectile.\nPowered by feasting, Grendel curls into a ball and knocks over anyone in his path. Jumping slams Grendel into the ground and generates a damaging shockwave.\nGrendel can be earned for free through means based on the lore of his Leverian entry. Once you’ve listened, you’ll begin your hunt for Grendel by acquiring:\nGrendel Neuroptics Locator\nGrendel Chassis Locator\nGrendel Systems Locator\nThese Keys are found in Arbitrations and will expose hidden missions on the planet mentioned in his Leverian for you. Grendel helps those in need \nand only those who are truly ‘empty’ will earn his pieces, guaranteed.\n\nDinner is served. An iconic helm for Grendel.\n\n\nA most curious Syandana and one favored by the gallant gourmand, Grendel.\n\n\nTear and chew through enemies with this unusual crankshaft-style greatsword. Grendel's signature weapon.\n*When using Grendel with his signature Masseter, he will be immune from crowd-control procs while doing Heavy Attacks.\n\nIt's all you can eat with this collection for the gallant gourmand. Includes Grendel Warframe, Glutt Helm, Masseter Greatsword, Sumbha Syandana and 3-day Credit and Affinity boosters.\n\nNew Passive: Receive 5% Ability Strength for every enemy within a 50m engulfed in flame (up to a cap).\nWorks fundamentally the same as it does now \ntap for quick fire, hold to charge for greater impact. Enemies already inflicted by any Heat Status effect will now take additional damage.\nFireball has a casting combo, if you use it multiple times rapidly it gets stronger.\nThe damage output and charge speed also scale off of one of Ember’s newest abilities...\nTime for a history lesson! Prior to Update 11.5, Ember’s second ability used to be “Overheat”, offering an aura of heat damage which also protected her from enemy fire. Almost SIX years later, it’s time for this ring of fire to come full circle.\nWhen cast, Ember Immolates herself with protective fire armor. Her current level of self-Immolation is indicated by a unique UI indicator; the higher the heat, the more damage resistance, and the more effective Ember’s other abilities become.\nThe Immolation meter will build slowly at first \nusing Ember’s Fireball or Inferno causes the meter to build faster. But be warned! If the meter reaches maximum, Ember will “overheat” and Immolation will cost progressively more energy per second the longer you stay in an overheated state. To prevent this from happening, use Fire Blast to expel a portion of your heat meter, or toggle Immolation off to reset meter build.\nCasting time has been greatly reduced, and the ability now strips armor from nearby enemies. The amount of armor removed scales in effectiveness based on current Immolation levels. On cast, this immediately reduces your Immolation level by up to half.\nUpon casting Inferno, all enemies currently within sight are struck by a fiery comet, lighting each target ablaze in a personal ring of fire. Inferno costs Energy per each target in sight, with the cost capped at 10 targets, at which other enemies are then free.\nIf an enemy ignited by Inferno comes in contact with another unit, the fire will spread, igniting them as well with a fresh ability duration. Damage of the heat AoE scales with current Immolation level.\nWith these changes, players will take a more active role in “bringing the heat” to all that stand in their way, with added protection that encapsulates Ember’s volatile nature.\n\n\nWhen revisiting Vauban, we aimed to retain his status as a crowd control powerhouse, while increasing his mobility and lethality to keep up with 2019 Warframe’s lightning-quick pace.\nInstead of sticking to surfaces, these new Tesla Drones will roll around, following the player. Once an enemy comes within range, these Drones will latch on and emit a shock that stuns the target and nearby enemies. Each Drone has a limited number of shock charges before it must be replaced. Hold cast to summon multiple Tesla Nervoses at once!\nAll four of his mines have been replaced with new options:\nA deployable beacon marks a location on the map. After a short countdown, the area is struck by a massive orbital laser explosion (and yes, it does work indoors).\nVauban’s two marquee powers have been combined into a new and devastating ultimate ability!\nWhen deployed, a Bastille will capture nearby enemies, stripping them of their armor over time. Players standing within a Bastille’s radius will gain a temporary armor increase, building up over time based on how many targets are currently being held in the Bastille.\nWhen a Bastille’s duration expires, it collapses into a brief Vortex at the center of the cast for easy group kills. Want the Vortex to appear sooner, or last longer? Holding the cast key will collapse all active Bastilles early, or if you have no Bastilles, holding will deploy a new Vortex instead.\nOverall, many of Vauban’s powers have been streamlined or replaced, making his tools less redundant, and much more versatile for keeping up with the pace of an average Warframe mission.\n*Vauban and Ember have been removed from Conclave in the meantime for balancing.\n\n\nThe trappings of royalty. Includes the deluxe Titania Empress Skin, Hawkmoth Skin for the Dex Pixia exalted weapon, the Mot Skin for the Diwata sword, Titania’s Heartwood Armor Set and the Dendrite Gunblade Skin.\n\n\nContains Euphrates Pet Armor for both Kubrow and Kavat, modeled on the intimidating, bladed look of the Tigris Shotgun.\n\nIntroducing Vasca! A true child of the night, and a drinker of life.\nBring your Kavat to the Plains of Eidolon at night to meet a Vasca Kavat \nsnoot to snoot. If your Kavat becomes tainted by a Vasca bite, Imprint it and breed 2 together for your own bloodthirsty kitty.\nDon’t want your Kavat to carry the virus? Visit Master Teasonai in Cetus for the Vasca Curative.\nPLUS, new Vasca Floofs can be acquired by Master Teasonai!\nDon’t feel like getting in a cat fight? Check out the Market for the Vasca Kavat Starter Kit!\n\n\nIntroducing a new Exilus Weapon Adapter that unlocks an Exilus Weapon Mod Slot for your Primary and Secondary weapons, granting you extra capacity to equip utility Mods. You can find the Exilus Weapon Adapter as an Offering from the main 6 Syndicates, from the new Requiem Relics, or in the in-game Market!\nThese Adapters will be for Primary and Secondary weapons only. Once we have finished making changes to the Melee system, we will re-evaluate the need for a Melee variant.\nThe conversation of tight capacity already exists without the addition of the Exilus Weapon Mod Slot, so we’re making these Slots default Polarities, meaning all Exilus Weapon Mods are \n(Naramon) or V (Madurai) Polarity.\nIf you’re familiar with Exilus Mods, they are utility or movement Mods, not sustained DPS grants. Below is a list of eligible Exilus Weapon Mods that sustain the utility intention. Anything not included in this list was deemed DPS affecting and not true ‘Utility’:\nAmmo Drum\nShell Compression\nTrick Mag\nRifle Ammo Mutation\nPrimed Rifle Ammo Mutation\nShotgun Ammo Mutation\nPrimed Shotgun Ammo Mutation\nPistol Ammo Mutation\nPrimed Pistol Ammo Mutation\nArrow Mutation\nSniper Ammo Mutation\nVIGILANTE: Supplies\nEagle Eye\nBroad Eye\nOverview\nAir Recon\nAERO: Periphery\nAgile Aim\nSnap Shot\nSpry Sights\nGun Glide\nDouble-Barrel Drift\nStabilizer\nVile Precision\nStrafing Slide\nSteady Hands\nGuided Ordnance\nNarrow Barrel\nTargeting Subsystem\nHush\nSilent Battery\nSuppress\nSoft Hands\nTwitch\nReflex Draw\nLock and Load\nTactical Reload\nEject Magazine\nTerminal Velocity\nFatal Acceleration\nLethal Momentum\nAdhesive Blast\nCautious Shot\nFomorian Accelerant\nKinetic Ricochet\nTether Grenades\nAs a result, the following Mods have been tweaked:\nAmmo Drum increased to +90% Ammo\nShell Compression increased to +90% Ammo \nVile Precision is now -90% Recoil\nLock and Load from 13 to 9\nTactical Reload from 13 to 9\nEject Magazine from 13 to 9\nVile Precision from 11 to 9\nCautious Shot from 12 to 10\nRifle Ammo Mutation from 9 to 7\nPrimed Rifle Ammo Mutation from 14 to 10\nShotgun Ammo Mutation from 9 to 7\nPrimed Shotgun Ammo Mutation from 14 to 10\nArrow Mutation from 9 to 7\nPistol Ammo Mutation from 9 to 7\nPrimed Pistol Ammo Mutation from 14 to 10\nSniper Ammo Mutation from 9 to 7\n\nUpdate 26 brings change to Warframe \nit iterates on the game and Melee is no exception. For months Phase 1 has been in your hands, and it’s time for Phase 2. What follows is a detailed overview of our design direction and intentions with this new Phase.\nWe are not touching Melee Riven Dispositions until we get updated data \nexpect advance notice when we close in on a date for this.\nWe want you to know how your use of melee and feedback on the systems have helped form Phase 2, and how some changes are included to allow for a more cohesive Melee experience. Our tools made Spin attacks optimal at the cost of the more interesting Melee system, and we’re trying to rectify that overall.\nPreviously we made several changes to the Melee system (as detailed in the Melee Rework Phase 1 Dev Workshop thread) including:\nIntroducing a new quick-melee attack\nFull VFX overhaul on elemental damage types\nAimed Slam Attacks instead of impacting directly below an airborne player.\nWhile select changes are to be rolled back (yes \nsee below before you react), the rest of the system served as a good foundation for this much more expansive Phase 2.\nPlease bear in mind that these changes are not set in stone, and some aspects of the new Melee system will be tweaked during the usual QA process. There are some more features being added later on, introduced in Melee Rework Phase 3 at a later date.\nSo what is covered in Melee Update Phase 2?\nThe Return of Equipped Melee and Manual Blocking!\nDodge Cancelling and Tactical Dodging\n3.            Stance Changes, Combos and You!\n4.            Smoother Combo Transitions\n5.            Combo Counter Rework\n6.            Changes to Slam Attacks\n7.            Goodbye Channeling, Hello Heavy Attacks and Lifting!\n8.            Weapon Stats, Mastery Limits and General Melee Changes\n9.            Mod Rebalancing / Functionality\n10.          Exalted Weapons\n11.          The Screens: Arsenal Changes\n12.          Aim Assist\n13.          Sticky Fingers when Equipping Melee!\n14.          Channelling 2.0 AKA “Rage Mode” and Future Plans!\nAs you can probably tell, this section is going to be a bit of a lengthy one, so make sure you sit comfortably, drink a nice cup of Greedy Milk and get ready to read all about how you can better turn your enemies into salsa with your favorite melee weapon!\nAn overarching note before you get started, is that every Melee weapon that was originally a single Elemental damage type has been converted to Physical + Element, allowing for more Status reliability as well (Silva and Aegis excluded given Flame Blade).\n\nOne of the bigger changes added to the Melee Rework: Phase 1 was the addition of fluid swapping between melee and Primary / Secondary Weapons. However, some players preferred the ability to manually block, making some of their builds less easy to manage. While we restored manual blocking for players playing ‘sword alone’, it wasn’t quite the same.\nThe good news is that both functions are back! Holding the weapon swap button will equip melee fully again, and the aim button will manually block when in this mode. Holding the Weapon Swap button while Exalted Melee is in play will also lock you into Exalted Melee mode! (Don’t worry, Auto Blocking is still a thing!)\nWe also have redesigned the utility of blocking: Blocking will now prevent 100% of damage,  with a blocking angle that is dependent on the melee weapon equipped. All successful Blocks will also add to the new Combo Counter!\n\n\n\nIn the above example, sword and shield weapons (such as the Silva & Aegis) have a blocking angle of 70 degrees, centered on the front of the player, where as a dagger weapon (such as the Dark Dagger) will only have a blocking angle of 45 degrees. (Previously all weapons had a locked blocking angle of 45 degrees upon the introduction of Auto Blocking.)\n\nOne of the older and larger complaints of the melee combo system has been the animation locks. Completing 7 step combos feels great, but the animations completely lock you into the movements. We are introducing two new ways to put more control in your hands:\n\nBy far, the biggest change you will see in the new Melee system is the alterations made to Stances, as well how Combos interact with one another. In the old (current) system, Combos are an effect of button presses, all leading into a chain of animations. In Melee Rework Phase 2, attacks are buttery-smooth and adaptable!\nThis rework of Combos applies to every Stance, not just the weapon types. For example, Tempo Royale (a Heavy Weapon Stance Mod) will still have different Combos than the Cleaving Whirlwind Stance, even though both Stances fit the Heavy Weapon melee type. The difference now, is that both share a design that uses common movements and attack types.\nWe also wanted melee attacks to feel more intuitive. For example, if you are aiming down the sights of a primary weapon or blocking incoming fire, and then hit the melee button, you most likely want to get in close! If you are not inputting a movement key while meleeing, it’s usually a sign you want to finish off your target. We wanted the new Combos to reflect that that existing movement, and so the new inputs reflect that situational awareness.\nIn most cases, the following improvements can be applied to any given Stance Mod equipped to a weapon (not just individual weapon types!):\nAll of these fresh Stance changes has shone light on Whip Stances in particular not being as desirable in comparison to the others. We’re aware of this and are working on a new Whip Stance!\n\nIn the old system, only the first follow up attack inputted would remain in ‘memory’ and would execute at the end of the initial attack animation. Any kind of input entered after the initial follow up was ignored until the next attack had started. In the new system, the next attack is being constantly updated, depending on the last input received.\nThis allows for last-second decisions on combo changes to occur immediately after the first attack has finished. No more waiting for a combo attack animation to end before you can start spamming the attack button again! Embrace the fluidity!\n\nThe Combo Counter will be getting a new functionality pass. Rather than just providing flat bonuses to damage, the Combo Counter will now also act as an expendable resource for new heavy hitting combat: HEAVY ATTACKS! This will replace channeling's key binding, and Section 7 below covers those changes. This counter will be increased in a more granular and rapid way, and can be built by using melee attacks, blocking damage, radial damage from Slam Attacks and hits from a thrown weapon (such as the Glaive).\nAs an expendable resource the Combo Counter should be easy to replenish, and the changes made should reflect how easy you can acquire and spend the Combo Counter resource. In addition, the ‘heaviness’ of an attack will have a measured difference on the amount of Combo Counter it increases. As a general rule, lighter, swift attacks will give lower additions to the Combo Counter than slower, heavy attacks will. Swing for the fences, Tenno!\nCombo Duration is now displayed as a bar underneath your Combo Counter!\n\nThe ragdoll effect of the Slam Attack is being removed (with some weapon-specific exceptions *cough*JatKittag*cough*), however it is being replaced with an effect that will push enemies back or knock them down, giving the player some breathing room, and setting the enemy units up for follow-up attacks.\nMelee Rework: Phase 1 introduced the global use of ragdoll effects on Slam Attacks, so this is the second item to be rolled back, and replaced with a better way to rain down death from above!\nAlso, all Melee weapons have received an updated Slam FX \ncome on and SLAM (attack), and welcome to the jam!\n\nChanneling will be saying its final farewells in the Melee Rework: Phase 2 update, and instead is being replaced with a new form of Heavy Attack, as well as a new Lifted status effect. As we said before, Channeling Mods will also be changed to support this new system, as well as providing a larger pool of utility to choose from in your builds.\nThese are the changes planned:\nBut what about the Channeling FX you ask? Prime Armor Channeling FX will now appear when the Combo Counter reaches 2!\n\nWith this new change, there is a broad-sweeping review of Melee weapons and how they function with the new system:\n\nSince the base damage of melee is being buffed, some notable Mods are getting a balance and/or functionality pass. With the wide amount of changes happening to Channeling and Heavy Attacks, some Mods have had to be reworked into other systems or have had changes to the way their damage scales.\nFor full transparency, some of these are nerfs to specific Mods, but we felt these were necessary to truly allow Phase 2 to be treated as a new beginning for melee. Our intention is to create engaging melee and Modding variety, which is not possible when there is a one-best loadout or single Mod that can kill almost anything in the game. We love killing things effectively, but we also want the combat to be engaging and feel powerful. Spin attacks still exist, but the repetition of them is something we’re trying not to force you to use. To reiterate: select tools made Spin attacks optimal at the cost of the more interesting Melee system, and we’re trying to rectify that.\nAt the moment, the current list of Mods and their proposed changes are listed below.\nThis update will also see some changes to the following Weapon, Arcane and Focus School buffs:\nAgain, some of these changes are subject to review and change. Now that Melee Rework: Phase 2 has been rolled out, there will surely be additional balance passes as usability and effectiveness are used (or abused).\n\nAll melee-based Exalted Weapons have received the Phase 2 functionality treatment, gaining access to the combo changes. For those of you who may have missed it, Wukong’s Exalted Iron Staff has already had this functionality implemented (with the exception of the new Heavy Attacks and changes to the Slam Attacks).\n\nPart of Update 26 involves a change of the Arsenal Screen, and how information is displayed. In the current system, your Arsenal screen looks something like this:\n\n\nIn Update 26, this screen is being reorganized to include Loadouts, Companions and Vehicles in tabs, while also giving more information about a weapon when selected:\n\n\nAs you can see, new stats for Heavy Attacks and Heavy Slam have been added, with channeling statistics removed.\n\nAim assist can be a help or a hindrance depending on what type of attack you wish to perform. While the current system either applies to all or none (on or off), the new system will have more intelligence on aim assist on a per-attack basis. As a general rule under the new system, Aim Assist will be disabled for almost all attacks in the Forward and Tactical Forward Combos, and enabled for most of the Neutral and Tactical Neutral Combo attacks. Of course if you don’t wish to use aim assist at all, you can disable it from the settings menu as normal.\n\nAnother common issue in user feedback was the unequipping of Gear Items (like the Codex Scanner), or dropping the ‘football’ (usually a pickup for Mobile Defense or Sabotage Missions) when equipping melee or using a melee attack. This has now been changed so that you will no longer drop items or unequip Gear Items when either equipping melee or using a Melee Attack!\nThere has been a lot of discussion around this addition, and while it will not be included in the Phase 2 update, there is a lot of work being put into its application. This system is very special and we want to make sure that it is not just a cool addition, but that it has roots in Warframes lore, and a story behind it. This is something we want to implement with a lot of in-game fanfare and details will become available as progress is made.\nFor now, that’s it!\n\nSome time has passed since our recent Arbitration tweaks \nafter observing stats and listening to your feedback, here are our findings and plans going forward:\n-The initial purpose of the changes, rebalancing the different mission types, was a success! Vitus Essence output is now more consistent across the board when tracking earnings per mission type.\n-We heard your thoughts regarding the droptables, especially the points about Mod drops. We think there is value to having both purchasable offerings as well as luck-based drops, but we can see how these items “diluting” Endo drops would be a concern.\nWe are addressing this desire for more consistent Endo from two angles:\nDue to the addition of Vitus Essence dropping from Drones, overall Vitus earnings are..... higher than we anticipated. We've decided to leave these values as-is, but will be closely watching the impact Arbitrations has on Kuva economy overall.\n\n\nReduced the number of Kavor Defector squads required for a reward in Defection Arbitration missions to match other mission types.\nReward is now every 2 Defector squads instead of every 4 squads\nAdded a Vitus Essence Decoration to the Arbitration Honors Store.\nTweaked the Vitus pickup FX to be larger and red.\nFixed Vitus pickups sometimes falling through the floor.\nIf you’ve made it to this part of the Update notes, you’re well aware that a lot of the Warframe meta may shift in new directions. With the current path Catchmoon weapons are on, it was time to bring Catchmoon weapons to a more reasonable power level, while still keeping them effective.\nDecreased fall off damage from 100 to 10.\nDecreased range of projectile from 40m to 20m and fall off range from 20-30m to 8-16m.\nPlease note that we are monitoring item usage for other weapons who use similar projectiles (Fulmin / Arca Plasmor), but will provide notice before we consider changing anything. We are simply monitoring at this phase.\n\nHeat Status procs now reduce targets' armor to 50% of the original value, with subsequent Heat procs refreshing the duration. Not hot enough for you? Applying the Status proc multiple times also turns up the Heat, dealing more damage per tick as the flames increase.\n\nTitania can now Transfer to the Operator during Razorwing.\nTitania’s cast animations are now an upper body animation only (except Razorwing), alleviating momentum cancelling lower body animations and trimming cast time.\nThorns Tribute now has Damage reflected AND reduced to help our little bug feel a little less squishy.\nTitania can spawn up to four more Razorflies if all Tributes are active, one per Tribute.\nRazorflies can now pick up Tributes.\nEnemies directly affected by Titania’s Lantern will now have any damage they take dealt to them when the Ability ends (a la Mind Control).\nOur goal with changes to tonemapping is to alleviate fatiguing images by introducing darker midtones. Things may appear more washed out in contrast to how it was before, but don’t worry, it’s all intentional. If you spot things that are out of the ordinary and real wack, please let us know!\n\n\n\n\nThe Options screen, Ayatan Treasures screen, and Dojo Room Options UI have received a fresh new look!\nThe loading screen now puts your Liset at the forefront in a new formation!\nTekko Prime now gains additional Status Chance when used with Atlas and/or Atlas Prime.\nBase status = 10%, Prime = 26%\nEach Kavat can now give you 3 Imprints (up from 2). This will apply to all Kavats that predate this update. If you’ve already used 2, you'll find 1 more ready to go!\nYou can now enter your own Dojo from the Clan screen when visiting someone else's Dojo, instead of having to return to your Orbiter first.\nYou can now double-click on a Dojo Decoration to place it, rather than being required to select a Decoration and hit the Place Decoration button.\nIncreased volume of Lua Rescue Alarm as per player feedback.\nPressing ‘enter’ in the Loadout selection while using the search box will now equip the first Loadout in the resulting grid.\nIncreased the Exposing Harpoon duration from 10 seconds to 15 seconds.\nSwapped the Kuva Bombard Crimson Dervish and 80 Endo drop to Condition Overload.\nAllies will no longer attack Synthesis Targets, thus giving you full control on if you want to Scan.\nWeapon stats will now be reflected in a slightly more rounded way. Innate Damage is added before anything on the weapon happens \nboosting the weapons base Damage and then renormalizes the Damage percentages. This makes Elemental Mods stack in a way you would expect.\nMoved the ‘Tips’ section in the Arsenal Upgrade screens to the button bar at the bottom.\nIncreased the ‘Additional Item Drop Chance’ of certain Amalgam enemies from 2% to 4% due to discovery that this drop was broken (fixed below). Happy hunting! \nThe Riven Cycle screen now gives you the option to view the Riven stats on every owned variant of said weapon. For example, I can now select either my normal Lex or my Lex Prime to view it’s said Stats.\n\n",

  "changes": "Tennogen & Nightwave Episode 5: Hotfix 25.7.7:\n\nTenno! We have intentionally left September as a bit of a ‘light’ month for releases. We wanted to give ourselves time internally to focus the whole team on finishing that infamous Whiteboard. However, our amazing and dedicated TennoGen community generate their success on our Updates! So you’ll find the headline of this week is dedicated to TennoGen Round 17.\nRegarding our recent Arbitration reward changes: the team is viewing not only feedback, but also statistics. Currently, our statistics are looking at the effects of adding Vitus to Drones, reward balance between different mission types, and the overall reward output, comparing Arbitrations both before and after changes. Stay tuned for changes coming in the near future.\nWe also have an official end date for Nightwave: Series 2! You have until October 13th to rank up and earn rewards, including the Emissary Operator Suit, Nikana Maligna Skin, Spore Ephemera and more!\nZealot Codes are required to engage in a new encounter brought in Episode 5.\nWhat’s a Zealot Code? If you’ve noticed this, you’ll know completing these gives you access to Zealot missions:\n(1 Zealot Code is acquired from completing 3 Infested Outbreak missions on a planet under an Outbreak. 2 planets are always under an Outbreak at all times, meaning you can get 2 Zealot Codes per day.)\nIf you have Zealot Codes in your Inventory, you can engage that respective amount of times plus with the more Codes you can continually earn.\nFun fact: this mysterious encounter will return after Nightwave Series 2 ends on October 13th as a permanent new boss fight.\n\nPlease note that it is the designers intention for the Saryn Ion Skin to not have an accent channel tint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMade experimental optimizations to content update speed especially when anti-virus programs are enabled.\nMade some micro-optimizations to content update and game loading.\nOptimized engine startup slightly.\nMade a micro-optimization to level loading and eliminated a bunch of harmless log warnings.\nFixed a crash that could occur if a squadmate summoned a Specter and then quit the game.\nFixed a game hitch when picking up a Stance Mod in mission.\nFixed script error when cycling a Riven Mod that is not in the currently selected collection grid category.\nVaporize's base Damage of 600 now multiplies with Mods equipped to your Sentinel's gun.\nIncreased Vaporize’s max Range to 30 meters from 4 meters.\nDecreased the cooldown to 10 seconds from 30 seconds.\nVaporize now has Punchthrough and can hit multiple enemies at once.\nUpdated the FX of Vaporize.\nThe Norg Mask, Mother’s Mask, and Grineer Mask now have a higher chance of appearing in Nakak’s store. This also fixes an issue where they would never appear \nsorry!\nSentinel Rivens will no longer get the ‘with an active pet’ requirement. Existing Rivens with this requirement have been changed to ‘without dying or becoming downed’.\nRemoved reflection textures from Operator heads to reduce shininess. \nChange Nightwave Silent Eliminator Act description to clarify that the minimum enemy level must be 30+, not the maximum\nPrevious:\nComplete an Extermination mission with level 30 or higher enemies without triggering alarms\nNew:\nComplete an Extermination mission with only level 30 or higher enemies without triggering alarms\nRevenant’s Reave ability is now an upper body animation only; alleviating momentum cancelling lower body animations.\nIncreased the Glaive’s radial audio so it’s bouncing can be heard.\nReduced minimum range at which Demolyst markers hide when close to the player to 5 meters from 8 meters.\nFixed the red visual marker hint for Demolysts not appearing in Gas City.\n",

  "changes": "Arbitrations Revisited: Hotfix 25.7.6:\nLast week we released a Dev Workshop (link on those words: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1128051-arbitrations-revisited-part-2/) outlining our plans to improve Arbitrations, revisiting the droptables and improving reward frequency to be more consistent between modes. From new players who just completed the Star Chart, to veterans returning for new Arcanes and Aura mods, we hope these changes result in a more satisfying gameplay experience overall.\nAll changes are potentially subject to later changes based on feedback, so try out a few mission types and tell us your thoughts!\nIn the original Arbitrations, Excavation missions were the clear outlier in terms of reward output for time spent. The following changes are intended to bring all other missions to the same level as Excavation, and also iterate on other community feedback:\nArbitrations now use regular rotation length for their rewards, with the exception of Excavation. Excavation timers have been adjusted to compensate. Example:\nEX: In lieu of a reward every 10 waves of Defense, you will now receive a reward every 5 waves.\nArbitration rotation cadence has been changed from “ABCCCCC...” to “AABBCCCCC...”, so that the same level of time investment is encouraged.\nReduced Endo Rewards drop percentage in the drop tables. Rare non-endo reward drop rates are unchanged \nyou’ll just get twice as many chances!\nArbiter Drones will now have a small chance to drop Vitus Essence on kill.\nVitus Essence dropped by destroyed Arbitration drones will have the special pickup notification.\nGhoul Purge inbox messages will no longer automatically open your inbox or play the transmissions if you have completed all of the Encrypted Journal Fragments. \nTweaked weather patterns in the Plains of Eidolon to prevent lengthy rainy periods. \nIncreased brightness of Ash’s Bladestorm mark slightly to improve visibility.\nAlly NPCs will no longer attack Garuda’s Blood Atlar Victims.\nUpdated Umbral Forma’s description to properly reflect the items it can be installed on (Warframes and Melee Weapons). Removed the ability to use Umbral Forma on K-Drives and Archwing Melee.\nTweaks Ostron eyes to make them less glowy.\nLimited Shawzin to 30 notes per second to prevent macros playing ridiculous amounts of notes and causing issues. \nEnemies may now “react” (without changing their Alert state) to you by stopping and looking around if you shoot a Silent weapon within 2-3m of them several times quickly. \nApplying a Look Link to the same item (ex: a Nova Look Link applied to a Nova) that uses default colours will now properly apply the default color. Previously, the original color would remain unchanged.\nMade micro-optimizations to core math libraries.\n",

  "additions": "With the launch of Orb Vallis, we added Bounty Bonuses as a way to reward players who went above and beyond to complete their missions. It’s about time that new system was extended to Plains Bounties as well!\nAll normal Plains of Eidolon Bounties have Bonus Objectives, meaning you will receive extra rewards for performing well:\nAssassinate: Draw out the target within X minutes.\nCaches: Complete within X minutes.\nCapture: Complete without killing an enemy.\nDefend the Area: Keep the control level above X%.\nExterminate: Complete within X minutes.\nHijack Drone: Keep drone health above X%.\nRescue: Keep rescue target health above X%.\nSabotage: Kill X enemies.\nArmored Vault: Keep the Vault health above X%.\n\nWe PSA’d back in July this year that a Friends List Cap was in the works, and the unlimited friends bottle has officially been corked. If you have more than 1000 friends, they will all stay on your list, you simply won’t be able to add any more.\nFor those of you with sizeable friends lists, we have added a few management tools to help whittle down the numbers, if you so wish:\nAdded batch remove option for friends who have been inactive for one, three, six, or twelve months. You will have to type in “Batch remove” as additional confirmation, so you don’t accidentally Thanos snap your friends list. \nAdded “Exclude Clan Members” toggle to the batch removal screen.\nAdded manual “Skip These Friends” text box to the batch removal screen.\n\n\nBy clicking the handy ‘Link’ icon in your Arsenal>Appearance screen, your active Chat window will be instantly populated with your build.

Note that we put a 15 second cool-down to reduce spam!\nWe also moved the Captura button on the Appearance screen to the upper right-hand corner and updated the icon to better match the Look Link style.\n\n\nBack in Update 25.4.0 we added the Shawzin to the Market for 40 Platinum \na placeable Decoration to remind you of The Sacrifice. Immediately the comments rolled in of ‘I wish we could play it’! And today that day has come:\nAll Shawzin purchases now come with a free ‘Shawzin’ Emote that you can equip to play your signature instrument! Those who have already purchased the Shawzin will retroactively have the Emote. With over half a dozen Scales, 3 frets and 3 strings, your song opportunities are endless. We cannot WAIT to see what you all come up with!\nWe have added 3 new Shawzin Decorations to the market with a different flair:\nMIMICA SHAWZIN \ncustom colour Shawzin! This Shawzin features an adaptive enamel that senses and mimics the coloring of any musician playing it.\nDAWN SHAWZIN \nLike the morning’s first light, this Shawzin will wake the spirit within.\nAnd NELUMBO  Shawzin \nwith it’s own sound-pack, it’s completely unique!\nSHAWZIN has been renamed to DAX SHAWZIN for clarity.\nSimply change your Shawzin while using the Emote using the menu provided!\nNumerous different musical scales to choose from\nPlay single notes and chords\nPlay along with Mandachord rhythm section\nPractice songs included (and a \"slow playback\" feature also available)\n\"This Is What You Are\", \"We All Lift Together\", and \"Smiles From Juran\" songs included!\nAdd vibrato and whammy bar effects\nRecord your Shawzin songs and share with friends by linking in Chat once you’ve achieved at least 4 Clems (points) by playing your track back\nShawzin can auto playback songs or you can play along\nMetronome mode option (120bpm with quantization feature)\nShawzin music can be heard in Squads and aboard landing crafts. Relays do allow you to play, but you will only hear your music and not your peers.\n\n\nMOAs, Cetus, and Companions are receiving a touch more player flare. New content designed or inspired by players has been added to Warframe!\nThe MOAnimation Contest’s winning emote by Zeaban works on all MOAs with an Emotion Module installed!

Keep an eye out at Nakak’s shop to obtain the majestic Norg Mask designed by Roimonstre and the beautiful Mother’s Mask designed by HUMERONYMUS.\n\n\nYou can purchase the Prized Companion Skin Pack in the in-game Marketplace! The pack includes both winning skins from the Tenno’s Best Friend contest: the Heino Kubrow Skin based on Skvirl’s dog and the Deaelra Kavat Skin based on DeaeIra’s cat!\n\n\nDoes your love for Infested Aesthetic spread through your being like a festering disease? Start crafting today and get your hands -\nor hand-like appendages -\non Infested Dojo pieces that would make Lephantis wriggle with pride.\n\n\nAdded 26 new Warframe Ability Tips in the Ability screen based on community submissions from the official Play Warframe’s #tenno-brainstorm Discord channel! Thank you to all those who participated and shared their knowledge. \nAlso edited several existing Warframe Ability Tips and replaced some of the tips on Augment Mods with new ones that focus on core ability features.\nAdded tips to the following screens!

Metallic surfaces, such as gold and steel (etc), are improved across the whole game to respond better to lights and reflections. This boasts the detail and depth that were always there but hard to see. If you notice any areas or objects that are brighter than expected please let us know!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may notice slight performance improvements in the Relays.

Should you wish to purchase more Slots, you may now do so (up to 120)! \nCompanion Weapon Rivens are available from Simaris’ Offerings for Standing (The War Within completion required), and yes, this includes the Artax! \nIf you recall back in Update 24.0 we removed Sentinel Weapon Rivens from the pool due to being lackluster in comparison to more applicable weapons. Adding Companion Weapon Rivens to Simaris’ Offerings allows players to freely choose these Rivens if they desire, and leaving it out of the general Riven Mod generation pool for those who don’t want them. \nThe follow Riven challenges now count towards Sentinel kills:\nKill X enemies\nKill X enemies that are on a dropship\nKill X enemies in a row while wall dashing/clinging without touching the ground\n\nWhen tracking down a bug why Paris Bows were doing less Damage than their Arsenal stats indicated, internal stats were reporting all Bows doing more damage than they actually were. Below is a review of all Bows (with the exception of the Lenz) and increased stats where appropriate:\nNormalized quick shots to have the same critical chance/damage and status chance as charged shots.\nWhile reviewing Bow stats the team has also refreshed all their FX (including the Lenz)!\nQuick Shot increased from 110 to 190\nCharged Shot increased from 220 to 380\nFlight Speed increased from 85 to 90\nAim Zoom decreased from 2.23x to 2x\nQuick Shot increased from 120 to 205\nCharged Shot increased from 225 to 410\nAim Zoom decreased from 2.23x to 2x\nQuick Shot increased from 60 to 92\nCharged Shot increased from 120 to 184\nFlight Speed increased from 85 to 95\nTightened the spread of the vertical fire mode and made the top arrow land on the reticle instead of the middle\nQuick Shot increased from 150 to 235\nCharged Shot increased from 250 to 470\nStatus Chance decreased from 50% to 46%\nCritical Chance increased from 20% to 34% \nCharged Shot increased from 460 to 700\nFlight Speed increased from 135 to 140\nQuick Shot increased from 130 to 168\nCharged Shot increased from 200 to 336\nQuick Shot increased from 120 to 160\nCharged Shot increased from 180 to 320\nQuick Shot increased from 100 to 115\nCharged Shot increased from 120 to 230\nQuick Shot increased from 130 to 180\nCharged Shot increased from 260 to 360\nFlight Speed increased from 85 to 95\n\nAdded Objective text, “Return to the Derelict” to the mission.\nAdded Objective text, “Visit Cephalon Simaris” to match the existing marker when the player arrives in the Relay and enhanced the distance display on the marker.\nAdded Object text, “Return to Orbiter” after talking to Simaris.\nAdded a marker after talking to Simaris that guides players to their docked Liset in the hangar.\nUpdated wording for the Arid Lancer Synthesis stage.\nAdded a marker to all nodes on Mars where Arid Lancer targets can be found instead of just one.\nChanged the “Return to Orbiter” marker to an Extraction marker.\nAdded “Return to Orbiter” and “Return to Simaris” Objectives to the fifth quest stage.\nAdded two new markers and hint text that presents the option to run the Synthesis tutorial and obtain Synthesis Scanners and Traps.\n\nAdded shiny overlay to destroyable loot crates and made the surrounding glass more transparent.\nUpdated door materials to be consistent with other updated doors.\nSlowed the music memory puzzle to reduce difficulty.\n\nIn order to avoid spoilers, Nightwave Acts that require completing content tied to Quests will now be locked unless you have completed the related Quest. Locked Acts will point you to the Quest required to complete in order to unlock it. The following Acts will see this change:\n“Don’t Fear The Reaper”, complete Kuva Siphon Missions, will now require The War Within Quest be completed. \n“Ascendant”, complete Halls of Ascension on Lua, will now require The Second Dream Quest be completed. \n“Grove Guardian”, kill Silver Grove Specters, will now require The Silver Grove Quest be completed.\nCatch-up Acts will now appear once you have less than 3 current-weekly Acts left to complete, as opposed to only appearing once you’ve completed the whole current week.\nChanged Nightwave Act progress / requirement number format (1500 to 1,500).\nFixed overlapping Nightwave UI after viewing an item diorama.\nFixed flickering issues with the orange screens in Episode 3 of Nightwave: The Emissary.\nFixed broken Nightwave UI when skipping through multiple Episode cinematics.\nFixed the Trinity Aura Helmet Blueprint appearing twice in the Nightwave Cred Offerings. \nFixed Nora Night’s Transmissions appearing when loading between Nightwave episodes.\n\n",

This will be a new player’s first encounter with Disruption, and it’s balanced accordingly.\nMoved Olympus mobile defense from Mars Olympus to Tharsis to replace ice planet Hijack.\n\nExpect higher-than-usual Credit Rewards from this Endless mode. While it may not be a perfect competition for the Index, it’ll be a change of pace for those looking to get some Credits with a change of scenery.\nThe new ‘Universal Syndicate Medallion’ can also be found in Disruption here!\nMoved Spy mission on Neptune Laomedeia to Nereid on the main path.\nReplaced Spy mission on Laomedeia with Disruption since it’s off the main path (ice planet hijack gets removed in the process as it has Jupiter in its skybox).\n\nIf you’re looking for how to earn Gauss, he can be earned here on Sedna’s Disruption mode!\nThe new ‘Universal Syndicate Medallion’ can also be found in Disruption here!\nMoved Sabotage from Kelpie to Rusalka to replace Capture\n\nThe new ‘Universal Syndicate Medallion’ can also be found in Disruption here!\n\nThe Kuva Fortress has a new endless mode! Here you’ll be able to earn Kuva in a new way! First \nthe mission reward tables themselves. This is of course the obvious choice, but as we developed these tables we know the fact that Boosters don’t work on them is an issue. So we’ve also added Kuva to the Grineer Demolysts that aim to destroy the Conduits of Kuva Disruption! The new ‘Universal Syndicate Medallion’ can also be found in Disruption here!\nMoved defense from Fortress Tamu to Nabuk to replace Capture\n\nA new node has been added on Lua featuring Disruption revisit your past for a chance to earn Somatic Fibres, a necessary component in Lua Lens construction!\nThe new ‘Universal Syndicate Medallion’ can also be found in Disruption here!\nDisruption has also been added as a possible mission type for Void Fissures, Sorties, Syndicate missions, and more!\n\nA new Focus Lens found only on Lua Disruption which allows you even greater Focus conversion!\n\nWe are starting small with this item as it has potential for a large impact on various economy elements that we want to carefully measure, but expect iteration and larger versions of these for rewards!

The old bug is as follows: Enemies who are attracted to Ivara’s Noise Arrow never regain intelligence if Ivara is invisible. The fix allows them to ‘finish’ their investigation of the noise and thus regain some form of intelligence.  This was exploitable in conjunction with the way that Interception missions work, and has been in the game for quite a long time on our end. \nFixed a long-standing issue where Clans were unable to destroy their Orokin Labs if it was created for a Solar Rail back in the day. Destroying the room now will cancel any pending Research tied to it and refund any Resources contributed to the Vault.

  "changes": "The Jovian Concord: Update 25.2.0:\n\nHealth increased from 100 to 150 (at max rank increased from 300 to 450).\nShield decreased from 125 to 100 (at max rank decreased from 375 to 300).\nWhy? Since Wukong’s new kit now involves an Armour buff, relying more on his Health will enable a better synergy.\nEnergy increased from 100 to 120 (at max rank 150 to 180).\nSprint increased from .95 to 1.0.﻿\nImproved his Primary/Secondary Energy blend on his Helmet tails.\nUpdated Wukong’s Arsenal Ability videos to reflect his Revisited abilities. \nReplaced existing Wukong tips with tips based on his revisited abilities.\nWukong evaporates into a fast-moving cloud of mist that will temporarily daze and paralyze enemies in his path. While in his cloud of mist, Cloud Walker has the additional mechanic of healing Wukong and his clone.\nHis movement can be interrupted by attacking at any time.\nCloud Walker has a much faster cast time which will no longer hold Wukong in place.\nWukong will no longer trigger laser traps or doors while using Cloud Walker.\nEnergy cost for Cloud Walker has been lowered.\nDefy will now taunt enemies while Wukong and his clone gain temporary invulnerability with reduced movement speed. All damage is captured, stored, and dealt back in a single furious long range staff spin attack.\nBased on the amount of damage prevented by Defy, Wukong and his clone will receive a temporary armour buff.\nPress ability again to trigger spin early.\nPrimal Fury will feature a new specialized and streamlined combo for Wukong’s legendary Iron Staff. As a preview of the upcoming Melee 3.0 system, Wukong’s Primal Fury uses new combo routes with simplified inputs providing a safe, limited space to try out coming releases.\nDamage for Wukong and his clone is redistributed for a more powerful feel, with a much higher status chance, larger base range, and some slash.\nCasting no longer holds Wukong in place. With new energy requirements, the cast cost of Primal Fury was lowered but cast drain was increased to be turned off and on as desired.\nAnimation has been trimmed.\nThe range of Wukong’s Iron Staff is always long, comparable to top range Zaws, and no longer needs to build combo to scale range.\nPlease visit our Dev Workshop post to read more about the reasons for these changes:\n\nMade micro-optimizations to dozens of UI scripts.\nMade micro-optimization when handling loot that falls into teleport pits.\nImproved handling of corrupt cache and malfunctioning graphics drivers.\nImproved error handling for failures to teleport people out of pits.\nImproved handling of corrupt download caches.\nImproved handling of crashing graphics drivers.\nRefactored runaway loop detection for improved performance.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed ability to choose any Relic type on any Void Fissure mission by queueing with squad.\nFixed Kela De Thaym not coming back down after completing the puzzle step which resulted in an infinite loop of firing missiles and Kela throwing insults at you. \nFixed ability to gain Set Mod bonus by using multiple copies of the same Mod if you have a Sentinel or Moa. Set Mod bonuses require different Mods from the Set to gain the bonus.\nFixed ‘Everything Old is New Again’ and ‘Loyalty’ Nightwave Acts not awarding Standing.\nFixed the ‘Silent Eliminator’ Nightwave Act not failing when an enemy detects you, regardless of alarms. Step your stealth game up!\nFixed Harrow’s Last Covenant Augment bonus time from headshots only appearing in the UI buff section (top right), not the Ability bar, where Ability would simply become \"in use\".\nFixed Mirage Sleight of Hand not working with Gas City objects.\nFixed Archwing enemy markers not showing more than 5 at once.\nFixed having 6 unranked Mods in the Trade slots appearing as fully rank after \"the slots are full\" message prompted, and accepting the Trade results in giving 1 max-ranked same Mod away instead of 6 unranked Mods, even when you didn't swap it.\nFixed Domestik Drones not spawning when returning from the Simulacrum.\nFixed a level hole in the Plains of Eidolon as reported here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/c0anj0/ay_yo_what_the_heck/\nFixed a level hole in the Orb Vallis tileset.\nFixed Equinox’s Duality Augment clone running off ledges so frequently.\nFixed 'Loot corpse' context action was not disappearing for Clients in the Gas City tileset.\nFixed cases where the Capture target will not make attempts to escape in the Gas City tileset.\nFixed Gas Traps not replicating SFX / VFX for Clients in the Gas City tileset.\nFixed the bright white FX projector on Electrical Melee FX.\nFixed the Bow Dryad Skin having misaligned strings when equipped on the Lenz.\nFixed missing Melee front-finisher sounds for the Tatsu.\nFixed zipline slide sound looping forever open dismount.\n",

  "changes": "Upon picking up a Datamass, a Melee to gun swap will automatically equip your Secondary weapon instead of your Primary weapon, which would make you drop the Datamass.\nPressing F when in Melee mode now switches you back to your \"other\" weapon. For example, if your Primary weapon is equipped when you trigger a Melee attack, you will return to your Primary weapon when you aim or fire. If you instead press F while in Melee mode, you will now equip your Secondary weapon.\nFixed a case where you could be left in an UNARMED state after using a non-Melee Exalted weapon (like Hildryn's Balefire) and went back to Melee when you had no other weapons in your loadout, having gone Melee only to that mission.\nFixed the Operator's Vazarin Guardian Shell not manifesting the charged Void Blast shield.\nFixed an issue where auto-blocking could cancel the charged/heavy Melee attacks.\nImplemented fixes toward briefly being unable to Melee after an Aerial Attack, which breaks the flow of battle.\nFixed being able to Quick Melee when you equip an Archgun with either a Primary or Secondary equipped before that.\nFixed the Melee-only Parry becoming a toggle that you can't release until you attack for Clients.\nFixes towards the Wise Razor Stance giving unintended extreme velocity. Comical yes, but clearly an oversight of gravity!\nFixed the Melee combo menu not updating with the proper button inputs to use Melee when using a controller. \nFixed missing Melee Channeling binding callout in the Advanced Melee screen of the Codex when using a controller.\nFixed a number of Melee attacks that could leave weapon trails active after the attack is finished.\nFixed losing your crouch position when initiating a Melee to gun swap while crouching.\nHildryn can use her custom dodge while in Aegis Storm at the cost of her Shields (50). We're starting with this cost because many abilities of this nature have movement restrictions that can be overcome with Augments (Peacemaker, Resonating Quake, Assimilate). We want to try out a movement cost before we tweak further based on feedback. \nRemoved additional sound for Hildryn's Haven ability based on feedback.\nRemoved ability to access Gear/Emote/Hotkeys when Hildryn is in Aegis Storm due to it breaking functionality. \nFixed Clients seeing incorrect animation when observing a Host Hildryn in her Aegis Storm ability.\n1) We have Restored Arcanes not triggering from Exalted weapons across the board by reverting the change made in Update 24.4.0:\nDispatch Overdrive now applies to Garuda’s Talons when equipped.\nBalance is a conversation that we constantly have, and we see you having as well. For some people the answer is don't nerf things, buff everything else. This is the path of least resistance for us, as most of the player base is happy when we buff, and angry when we nerf. However this has a few side effects that impact the game as a whole. First, with more damage, the time to kill on enemies is lowered and the value of Crowd Control declines even more (Vauban?!). Higher max damage also means that players with the latest bells and whistles can easily kill bosses in an instant, and overcome any challenge with ease. The more your play, the easier the game gets!\nSo far we have been kicking the can down the road, accepting power creep and its consequences on the game \nand often this game is a 'kill all the things' based game. We've mostly done nerfs on things that could be automated, required no player interaction or removed options from the game by making all other choices bad. We will continue to wrestle with this, but the most important part is when and if we decide major balance changes are needed, we will let you know and it will be the result of a lot of consideration.

  "changes": "Buried Debts: Hotfix 24.4.2:\nTenno, thank you kindly for your feedback, videos, and reactions so far on last night's Melee changes! We've been live for less than 24 hour with Phase 1 and we're going to start experimenting a little bit with some feedback. Our first experiment has to do with players who are truly committed to 'The Sword Alone'.\nManual blocking/parry has been added when players wield only a Melee weapon in a mission (i.e NO Secondary or Primary equipped). This is possible because in this specific state, the keybindings are free to allow this manual blocking. We do not plan on adding it to any other state yet. The default keybind for this is RMB/Right Mouse Button (LT for controller), as it was in the past.\nMelee Channeling can no longer be rebound on Controller due to it completely breaking Melee 2.99997 changes. We apologize for the discomfort this may cause for those who have built their controllers comfortably around a different binding. You can't make an omelette without cracking some eggs!\nFixed a widespread issue where players using Controllers could no longer Aim after the Melee 2.99997 changes. This affected numerous mechanics like Aim Gliding, Melee Channeling, etc.\nWe’ll be continuing to monitor controller issues as they arise! If you’re still having issues, restoring your Controller bindings to ‘Default’ will help in the meantime. Please let us know of further issues!\nFixed an issue where attempting to reload your Primary/Secondary while in Melee mode would not transition you back to your gun.\nRemoved Hildryn's Shield-gate mechanic that was applying to Eidolon Lures, resulting in an invulnerability for 3 seconds after their Shields are destroyed before becoming vulnerable again.\nFixes towards Teralyst (and possibly Gantulyst/Hydrolyst) getting stuck in the Plains which caused constant teleporting all over the landscape.\nFixes towards Teralyst (and possibly Gantulyst/Hydrolyst) not using abilities.\nHildryn's Main Blueprint has moved from Vox Solaris' Offering Rank of Shadow (Rank 5) to Agent (Rank 2).\nGreatly reduced the camera angle when casting Hildryn’s Haven.\nFixed Hildryn’s Shield Pillage not removing Status Effects for Clients.\nFixed Hildryn being able to use ziplines (and other context actions) while in Aegis Storm.\nFixed script errors when casting Hildryn’s Balefire.\nImprovements towards the Operator curly hair hairlines to show less scalp.\nBalanced the Jat Kittag spark FX for less visual noise.\nThe Rakta Dark Dagger’s innate upgrade on equip is now called Mind Haze.\n",
  "fixes": "Clarified and corrected the Buried Debts data-hashes section of the World State Window to read as ‘UNDISCOVERED’ when you haven't scanned any data-hashes yet, instead of ‘SCANNED’.\nUpdated the Diluted Thermia description to read:\nA magma like liquid that is diluted with coolant during the extraction process. Thermia can be found fracturing the surface of the Orb Vallis during thermal flare-ups. Could this be the key to weakening the Exploiter Orb's defenses?\nDiluted Thermia now displays as a special pickup in the UI (similar to Argon Crystal, etc).\nAmalgam Mods can now be Chat linked and found in the Codex.\nFixed a crash when engaging with a Thermia Fracture.\nFixed Coolant Canisters disappearing if you picked them up too quickly.\nHotdropped a fixed early this morning that was preventing players from downloading Warframe from the website. If you experienced this issue please try again!\nFixed real money purchased weapons (Prime Access, etc) not coming potatoed (Orokin Catalyst). Missing potatoes have been rectified to affected accounts in either your Inventory or the respective potatoless weapon depending on if you potatoed after the purchase was made.\nFixed inability to login when playing in Steam Big Picture mode.\nFixed cases of some enemies not attacking in Plains or Orb Vallis.\nFixed a crash that occurred when unzooming or switch weapons during Mining.\nFixed inability to Trade if it includes an Ayatan Star.\nFixed Exard Scaffold not resetting damage resistances on Sentients.\nFixed Harrow’s Penance recast not refreshing Duration.\nFixed Gara’s Splinter Storm self timer not being refreshed when affected by Mass Vitrify.\nFixed the Tarock Thrown Blade Skin not applying to the Spira Prime or Hikou Prime once thrown.\nFixed missing FX/texture for Rhino’s Iron Skin.\nFixed missing Elemental FX for the Glaive Prime.\nFixed Kitgun FX lingering perpetually if the Glaive is also equipped.\nFixed Warframe Ability videos turning white after unfocusing on the Ability.\nWe’re still seeing some playback issues with these that we’re investigating! \nFixed missing functionality when clicking an active Resource Booster in the UI.\nFixed Foundry UI notifications displaying a filepath.\nFixed [PH] context actions in the Mastery Rank 27 test.\nFixed a script error when accessing the Dojo Room Option Panel.\n",

A massive amount of fixes, changes, additions and more have been collected since our last Mainline (The Profit-Taker) and splayed below for you! Sometimes WIP features slip through the cracks and launch unbeknownst to us \nso if you see some weirdness please let me know!\nLaunching shortly after this Update is live is our first Operation of 2019. This entire Update is about 2.7 GB, get ready! What follows is a summary of the Operation post!\nThis Operation begins with a Community Goal \nthe hunt is on, Tenno. Can you unlock the secrets of the dead? If you've been paying attention to Devstreams, you may already know where to start looking...\nYou can receive Operation Specific Rewards by participating in parts of this event.\nThe first reward is more abstract \nyou can expand the Orb Vallis by solving a puzzle.... Together.\nThermia fractures are cracking open the surface of Venus, a consequence of Nef Anyo’s unrelenting greed. He’s willing to do whatever it takes for a quick profit, including putting the whole Orb Vallis at risk. By figuring out how to stop the Thermia fractures, you're able to earn these rewards:\nOperation Emblem\nAmalgam Mods x4\nOperation Sigil\nOpticor Vandal\nYou get 1 point for each Thermia Fracture you close \nif you close 4 Fractures with 1 Coolant canister, you get 3 bonus points (7 total)!\nAnd eventually, an incredible new boss fight will unlock where you can earn Hildryn! We are expecting this to take approximately a week with the estimated pacing of this Operation. Free players \nwe appreciate your patience, rest assured Hildryn is a completely free Warframe for you to earn as the Operation unfolds!\nGood luck, Tenno. You can all help each other if you know where to look.\n\n\n\n\nHildryn can be obtained via the Market, Little Duck Offering (Main BP), and as drops from a new Boss fight.\n\nHildryn Asuron Helmet can be acquired in the Market and in Nightwave’s next Series Offerings.\nSurator Syandana can be acquired in the Market.\nLarkspur can be acquired in the Market and in the Tenno Lab Clan Research.\nHildryn Collection can be acquired in the Market.\n\n\nQuaro Syandana can be acquired in the Market.\n\nLimbo Limina Collection can be acquired in the Market.\n\nTatsu can be acquired in the Market.\n\n\nTenno \nyour favorite melee weapon probably feels a little different today. Today we bring you Phase 1 of 2019’s melee upgrade \nwe hope you love all the gorgeous new visual effects, streamlined combat, and high fidelity hit reactions! Here's what you can expect:\nNo one knows the power of their Arsenal better than the Tenno \nyour adaptability and skill with the blade will be tested, and as we continue these changes, we rely on your feedback!\nIf you missed the full workshop discussing Phase 1, you can catch it here:\n\n\n\nGlaive slam range increased to 5m\nWarfan slam range increased to 5m\nDagger slam range increased to 5m\nDual dagger slam range increased to 6m\nClaw weapon slam range increased to 6m\nGunblade slam range increased to 5m\nNunchaku slam range increased to 6m\nSword and Shield slam range increased to 7m\nSingle Sword slam range increased to 7m\nBlade Whip slam range increased to 7m\nRapier slams increased to 6m\nDual Sword slam range increased to 8m\nTonfa slam range increased to 8m\nMachete slam range increased to 7m\nNikana slam range increased to 6m\nHammer slam range increased to 9m\nStaff slam range increased to 6m\nPolearm slam range adjusted to 7m\nScythe slam range increased to 8m\nHeavy Blade slam range increased to 8m\nFists weapon slam range increased to 8m\nSparring weapon slam range increased to 7m\nA full Visual FX pass has been done for Phase 1! Because this is Phase 1, it 'means all the unique weapons will have new generic FX for a little while (Jat Kittag etc.) until we can get through them all and make new clean variants'.\nNew and cleaner FX have been created with the idea of beautifully short, highly detailed lifespans. Not infinite \nmeaning the 'Constant Weapon Trail' option will be removed as a result of this change (at least for Phase 1, we really do think it looks better removed).\nBLOCKING\nBlocking with a melee weapon is no longer keybound, it is automatic when facing enemies who are dealing damage to you in melee mode. Your Reticle determines all!\nCHANNELING\nChanneling is now a toggle set to your alt-fire button when in melee mode.\nYour 'F' button (if using default key bindings) now exclusively swaps between Primary and Secondary weapons with a tap.\nYour left mouse button is gun fire, always, instantly.\nYour right mouse button is now aim, always, instantly.\nOPTIONS:\nWe are adding a toggle to preserve one aspect of the older melee system. You will be able to toggle an option, allowing you to continue melee attacks with the left mouse button once in melee mode.\nUpdated Reticles: Melee mode has received its own reticle!\nArchwing: Arch-Melee & Archgun now also use the 'instant swap' behaviour.\nDual Wield (i.e Glaive & Single Secondary) is still supported!\nExalted weapons will also benefit from the uninterrupted swaps! Be aware that Energy will still drain, even when swapping between weapons!\nAI hit reacts are getting updated! Enemies will have a more visceral/realistic response to the various hits you dish out.\nWith Melee Blocking now automatic, the Blocking angle has been reduced to 45 degrees.\nSigma & Octantis and Cobra & Crane Shield throw animations have been shortened and speed increased. \nIf using no custom Energy color, the weapon will inherit the colors of the Elemental FX (or base trails if no elements are present). This unifies all colors (swing FX, trails, hit FX, etc).\nRakta Dark Dagger’s equipped bonus is now an innate upgrade that triggers on equip and lasts for 30 secs (refreshed on Melee equip).\nVaykor Sydon’s Radial Blind now triggers upon toggling Melee Channel on/off if you have the required charges stored.\n\n\nIntroducing a new way to customize your Warframe: Ephemera!

The Tenno have improved their hair care routine and it shows!\n\n\nCorpus inspired Highbrow, Two-Sloops, and Thugs Blueprints are available from Roky! Lord a tha board!\nBounties are now available out in the Plains of Eidolon! Certain tents placed throughout the Plains contain a console that encompasses the power to contact Konzu himself (when he’s not on his early lunch). \nWith Bounties now available out in the Plains, Incursions have been removed. These were meant to give players something optional to do as they spend their time in the Plains, but since Bounties can be activated on command, they no longer serve a purpose.\nPolished numerous Junction boss fights to have better power usage and combat pacing. \nRewrote Melee section of the “Training: Basics” Codex entry. \nRewrote Melee 2.0 section and renamed to “Advanced Melee” and moved to be beside \"Advanced Movement\".\nRemoved \"Dark Sectors\" section from the Training Codex.\nThe Warframe Abilities screen has received a visual and functional overhaul! \nAbility information is now displayed in a more condensed form, with hover-over functionality to display specific Stats and expand the information. \nA new ‘Tips’ section can be hover-overed to display tips for that respective Warframe’s Abilities such as tricks to synergize with other Warframes, most effective Damage output methods, Ability interactions within the Warframe it self, and more!\nRespective Ability videos now also appear upon hover-over to add that little extra spice! This initial Ability video aspect is currently functional for Excalibur, Mag, Volt, Garuda, Baruuk, Revenant, and Hildryn! More to gradually come!\nYour chosen UI Theme is now thematically reflected.\nThe Arcane Manager has received a visual overhaul to match the chosen UI Theme! Along with the new visual appeal, the Manager now also:\nLists which Arcanes you do not own (hovering over will display information)\nArcane Ranks displayed on the right-side are now selectable, allowing for a more direct Rank Up mechanic.\nThe Dojo Trading screen has received an overhaul!\n6 Trading Slots instead of 5! \nFaster item selection responsiveness and improved UI to help you easily find the items you want to Trade.\nRespective Warframe Ability stats can now be seen in the Warframe Arsenal Upgrade screen.\nThe Dojo Decoration screen and Dojo Room Construction screen now reflects your chosen UI Theme!\nHUD Damage Numbers and Affinity Numbers can now be separately toggled in the Interface Settings! \nRight clicking an Arcane in the Mod Upgrade screen now unequips it, similar to Mods.\nIf Coupons, Boosters, 2x Events, etc are active, hovering over the Icon in the top right will display a list of the respective active events.\nNumerous widespread changes to capitalized vs lowercase UI text.\nAdjusted the size and positioning of the generic notification popup.\nRemoved “.” period characters from names of Weapons and Pets.\nUpdated all mentions of Solar Map/Solar Chart to Star Chart.\nAdded checkmark to the ‘Ready to Trade’ UI screen.  \nImproved successful Mining discrepancies where it would appear you hit the perfect sweet spot in the heat gauge but were told otherwise.\nFixed stats when previewing Amp Parts while the Preview Gilded option is toggled appearing as Ungilded > Gilded. Now, it compares Gilded > Gilded with the new Amp Part.\nFixed UI lock after selecting ‘Replicate’ and then closing the Research screen in the Dojo.\nFixed certain Warframe Passive descriptions in the purchase screen and info popup not showing proper values.\nFixed UI breaking when sending someone a Gift and then traveling to Fortuna.\nFixed some UI Themes not maintaining respective text color.\nFixed Gear Spiral items displaying darker than expected when viewed in the Arsenal.\nFixed the Mining UI will disappear if killed while Mining.\nFixed Valkyr’s Warcry UI not reflecting the Eternal War Mods timer increase.\nIn Update 24.2, we included a number of changes to increase controller responsiveness. The initial changes caused the slightest changes in trigger pressure to interrupt firing and ADS \nwhich is being experienced predominantly with continuous fire weapons such as fully automatic and beam weapons (including Mining tools). This is due to a far too small trigger release threshold between firing and not firing.\nThis is, however, very effective with pistol weapons where a limited threshold allows for quick trigger taps.\nWith that said, this update is bringing the following changes to address the above:\nWe have increased the trigger release sensitivity so that there is more space for error between firing and release. This will help curb the muscle fatigue experienced with having to maintain constant pressure on the triggers as well as alleviate the accidental breaks in firing and aiming. This will require a bit more pressure to be released on the triggers before you will stop aiming and firing.\nWe increased trigger release sensitivity but maintained press sensitivity to strike balance between quick tap and continuous fire weapons. In other words, we have maintained the firing ease of Pistol weapons with quick trigger taps but have increased the freedom to apply various levels of pressure with continuous fire weapons.\nWhile this has felt much better overall in testing, we know that some may find that the increase still constraints gameplay in some form. More importantly, Tenno with disabilities may also find that this limits their ability to play. So we have also added 2 new sliders in Options > Controls to adjust trigger sensitivity to your liking:\n\nThe sliders will allow you to tailor exactly how much pressure you feel is most comfortable/close to your preference of play.\nThe homing energy projectiles that Enthrall pillars emit now have a chance to Enthrall enemies while inflicting damage if there is room in the Enthrall cap. This allows Enthrall to spread more organically, and as the cap is reached, damage continues on other targets. \nFixed Revenant becoming stuck in his spinning animations if he becomes downed during Danse Macabre. \nFixed Mesmer Skin consuming multiple charges when getting hit multiple times in the same frame from the same enemy (e.g. a projectile that hits you and explodes).\nLowered the Standing cost of the Tulok and Param Fishing Spears to 500 and made them available at Rank 0.\nImproved the visibility of the Color Pigment Research in the Clan Log by adding further detailed information as well as color coded texted to each respective Pigment.\nAssassinate encounters are no longer global, they are now localized to a specific area within a radius. \nThe encounter can be abandoned by leaving the radius.\nWe made this change because we received feedback that players are getting frustrated that they are so widely separated when trying to achieve the same goal in Bounties. \nChanged bonus objective of the Corpus Assassinate Bounty on Vallis: the Bounty will now fail if enough Credits are not gathered before the timer runs out, and Tenno will earn a bonus for collecting enough Credits within a shorter amount of time. This Bounty didn’t have a failstate like others, so we tweaked the objective and bonus objective for consistency. \nThe timer now scales based on how many players are in the squad. \nThe less players there are the more time is granted to complete.  \nAssassinate target now scales based on how many players are in the squad. \nChanged the cover evaluator for the Assassination targets in Orb Vallis Bounties so that they don’t run as far to find cover.\n\nOnce the 'mission complete' interval is met, players can head to extraction any time they choose (i.e 5 minutes for Survival). \nAny player at extraction triggers a countdown timer. \nIf all players leave the extraction zone, the countdown timer is cancelled.\nWhen the timer is up, the extraction ship arrives and any players in the extraction zone leave.\nAnyone still playing can extract later any time they choose.\nWe have made some much requested changes to the responsiveness of two things in Warframe: Weapon swapping and automatic doors. Right now in Warframe, if you are connected as a client you may have experienced delays in responsiveness of either of these essential things! The changes should result in a much smoother experience:\nSwapping weapons as a Client will now feel more responsive because we've made it Client-Authoritative.\nAutomatic Doors have been made Client-Authoritative.

The Archweapon Deployer can be obtained by completing the Orb Heist Phase 3 Bounty.\nAtmosphere Arch-Guns consume Ammo as opposed to unlimited Ammo/Battery in Archwing. Specifically new Heavy Ammo Drops which can be found from Corpus enemies in Orb Heist missions. Heavy Ammo Drops also reset the 10 minute cool-down when picked up, or replenish Ammo if needed.\nAtmosphere Arch-Gun can be summoned in normal missions with the Archweapon Deployer, but once Ammo has been depleted there is a 10 minute cool-down until you can summon again. The intent here is to allow you moments of beefy damage output, and not become just another Primary/Secondary weapon.\nDamage increased from 40 to 50.\nCritical Chance increased from 10% to 24%.\nStatus Chance increased from 5% to 12%.\nMagazine size decreased from 250 to 200.\nAmmo Capacity set at 400.\nReload speed set at 2 seconds.\nMastery Rank increased from 0 to 1.\nDamage increased from 35 to 40\nCritical Chance increased from 15% to 40%.\nCritical Damage increased from 2x to 2.6x.\nStatus Chance increased from 10% to 14%.\nAmmo Capacity set at 50.\nDamage fall off reduced from 100-350 to 60-120.\nReload speed set at 2 seconds.\nMastery Rank increased from 0 to 1.\nDamage increased from 60 to 110.\nCritical Chance increased from 25% to 28%.\nCritical damage increased from 2x to 2.2x.\nStatus Chance increased from 10% to 14%.\nAmmo Capacity set at 256.\nReload speed set at 1.4 seconds.\nMastery Rank increased from 0 to 2.\nDamage increased from 200 to 250.\nCritical Chance increased from 15% to 22%.\nStatus Chance increased from 10% to 16%.\nAmmo Capacity set at 80.\nReload speed set at 2 seconds.\nProjectile width decreased from 30m to 10m.\nMastery Rank from 0 to 3.\nDamage increased from 45 to 56.\nCritical Chance increased from 10% to 14%.\nStatus Chance increased from 25% to 30%.\nMagazine size decreased from 250 to 240.\nAmmo Capacity set at 480.\nReload speed set at 2 seconds.\nDamage reduced from 200 to 120.\nCritical Chance increased from 5% to 20%.\nCritical Damage increased from 2x to 2.2x.\nAmmo Capacity set at 240.\nReload speed set at 1.2 seconds.\nMastery Rank from 0 to 4.\nDamage increased from 275 to 310.\nMagazine size decreased from 60 to 30.\nAmmo Capacity set at 90.\nReload speed set at 2 seconds.\nMastery Rank from 0 to 4.\nDamage reduced from 1800 to 1200.\nCritical Chance increased from 25% to 30%.\nMagazine size decreased from 100 to 10.\nAmmo Capacity set at 30.\nReload speed set at 2 seconds.\nMastery Rank from 0 to 5.\nDamage increased from 40 to 50.\nCritical Chance increased from 10% to 28%.\nCritical damage increased from 2x to 2.4x.\nStatus Chance increased from 5% to 12%.\nAmmo Capacity set at 600.\nReload speed set at 2 seconds.\nChanged Fire Rate from 16.67 base ramping up from 13.33 to 25 Fire Rate over 30 rounds to: 25 base rate ramping up from 13.33 over 30 rounds.

Since her revisited kit depends on enemies effectively hitting each other, we changed the passive to make Nyx simply harder to hit.\nMind Control has a 4 second wind up at the start where incoming damage will cause the target's damage output to increase. The stronger your weaponry, the deadlier the output of your victim! \nReminder: All damage inflicted to the target will apply once Nyx deactivates Mind Control, or when the Duration runs out. \nBetter 'follow Nyx and attack enemies' AI pass.\nMind Control can now be cast while moving, and no longer halts Nyx in her tracks!\nThe cast time for Mind Control has been decreased, so you can better use the 4-second window to ‘power up’ your new minion!\nNyx’s passive ability to make enemies miss will be deactivated when she is using Absorb, meaning no shot will be wasted!\nNo longer deals any damage and will temporarily disable Armor & Shield, slow down Infested units, and disable Ancients' Auras.\nPsychic Bolts can be cast once on up to 6 targets. Kill these targets before you can cast again, OR hold '2' to reset targets and cast again!\nAbsorb damage type is now based on the damage types it absorbs.\nBaseline Energy Capacity increased to hit 225 at Max Rank.\nLantern can be cast up to 4 times at once (new targets replace old). Targets will gradually float back to their starting positions. You will be able to 'explode' all targets by holding the Lantern cast.\nRazorwing has a 'Vacuum' built in!\nVenus Shield Ospreys the spawn Nullifier bubbles only spawn if the Orb Vallis Alert level is 3+ and if the enemy level is 20+. \nLevel 2+ Alert level will spawn Shield Ospreys that don’t spawn Nullifier bubbles. \nA max of 2 Nullifier bubbles can be created per Drone.\nTotal active Nullifier bubbles (from all Drones) in the area will not exceed 4 \n10 bubbles (scaling with player count).\nQuick fire area-of-effect returned to 2m as intended.\nCharged fire projectile speed increased.\nMag size increased from 45 to 48.\nAmmo capacity increased from 270 to 288.\nClip size no longer affects charge time and is now set at 1 sec.\nCharged fire now deals self damage.\nReduced the shockwave distortion FX.\nChanged from semi auto to automatic.\nAdded a small amount of recoil for feedback when firing.\nnow has proper accuracy stats so mods will effect it\nFirestorm and Terminal Velocity Mods can now be equipped.\nReduced Aim Zoom from 2.23 to 1.6x.\nDamage-over-Time damage is now affected by +damage mods\nUpdated the overall FX.\nFire Rate increased from 2 to 3.\nAmmo capacity increased from 60 to 72.\nClip size decreased from 10 to 8.\nFire Rate increased from 2.67 to 3.33.\nAmmo capacity increased from  75 to 96.\nClip size increased from 15 to 16.\nCritical Chance increased from 5% to 14%.\nIncreased lock on angle of sticky beams from 15-30 to 40-60 (first number is angle it can obtain a lock, second number is when beam will lose it’s lock).\nIncreased Mag size from 40 to 60.\nIncreased Ammo capacity from 200 to 300.\nReduced the delay until you can use primary fire after using it's secondary fire.\nReduced aimed recoil.\nIncreased the recharge rate of Pax Charge when used with all Chambers apart from Catchmoon.\nPax Soar now also reduces the effect of gravity when firing a Kitgun.\nPax Bolt chance to activate increased from 50% to 100% at max rank.\nSplat Loader reload speed increased from 1.9 to 1.7 secs when used with Gaze Chamber.\nKillstream Loader status chance increased from 11 to 13% when used with Catchmoon Chamber.\nTombfinger Chamber area-of-effect damage origin now matches point of impact instead of behind it.\nOne major issue address is the fixing of an issue where almost 50% controller input was required before a hip-fire camera manipulation could be executed. We’ve decreased coded deadzones to allow for more refined, precise aiming and removed the inherited velocity when shifting directions. Players should now notice an immediate falloff in camera movement once input is no longer applied to the control sticks.\nAdditionally, we have added a number of mathematical improvements regarding the ramp and acceleration curves used to interpolate control stick input. This should make the camera manipulations feel much smoother and allow for a closer approximation of circular movement, compared to the very ‘square’ like motions we had previously.\nWe’ve also increased the amount of vertical movement seen when manipulating the control stick to reduce the amount of asymmetry between it and horizontal movement. There is still a bias towards the horizontal plane, but moving the camera up/down should not feel so drastically different when now compared to left/right movement.\nFixed Void Mode being toggled/stuck on sometimes due to interaction with the Power Menu on controllers.\nAnimal Pheromone Synthesizer items have been added to The Business’ Offerings! When deployed before using an Echo-Lure, these increase the chance of attracting a Rare variant of the respective animal. \nIncreased range of Tranq Rifle pulsing sound from 100m to 180m. \nFixed the UI breaking and Echo-Lure/Tranq/Mining Lasers not functioning after dismounting a K-Drive.\nFixed having no weapon when getting downed while the Echo-Lure or Tranq is equipped.\nFixed Tranqing an animal during its despawn animation would cause instant disappearance.\nFixed Echo-Lure’s not changing pitch for Clients.\nFixed a case of the Echo-Lure UI indicator not matching true pitch of the animal call.\nFixed Conservation UI (and other custom scopes) being disabled when dismounting a K-Drive.\nFixed potential cases of the Conservation start point or the call point spawning too far into the edge of the map, making it unreachable.\nFixed inability to use Warframe abilities after mounting a K-Drive with a Fishing Spear equipped.\nFixed rare case of Orb Vallis Servofish repeatable getting stuck in a specific spot.\nFixed Servofish frequently being worth 0.0 points.\nThe initial Trading Post screen and Research screen in the Dojo have been reworked to not only be more functional and aesthetically pleasing, but also to match your chosen UI Theme! \nResearch in progress now displays contribution progress in the right panel and incomplete material contributions will appear faded.\nHovering over non-Credit Research requirement materials now shows the item info as well as the amount owned.\nChanges:\nRemoved ‘-50% Magazine Capacity’ from the Precision Munitions Mod in Conclave.\n",

  "changes": "Beasts Of The Sanctuary: Update 22.20.0:\nOur lady of poison is taking the center stage with Saryn Revisited 2.0! Yes, that’s right! She has been revisited for a second time, and this time we took a closer look at increasing the fun factor by removing layers of complicated synergies and giving Toxin Lash and Molt a long deserved encore.\nRead all about our intent and full details on the changes in the official Saryn Revisited 2.0 Dev Workshop!\nIncreased Status Chance from 10% to 50% (scales with Ability Strength). \nA meter in the bottom right corner of your screen will show the number of affected enemies and how much damage is being dealt per tick to said enemies.\nRecasting Spores detonates all active Spores and will deal 2x the damage on an inflicted enemy based on the number of active Spores and the current damage per tick. \nVenom Dose Augment: Spores cast on allies temporarily grant them additional Corrosive damage to all attacks.\nAfter casting, Saryn receives a momentary speed boost for a short duration. \nMolt now scales similar to Rhino’s Iron Skin \nAll the initial damage it takes in the first 3 seconds will make it stronger. Any damage it receives after that point will target the absorbed health.*\n*Damage absorbed is shown in a buff indicator at the top of the screen.\n*Once all absorbed damage has dispensed, Molt explodes dealing Toxin damage to nearby enemies.\nNow has a 100% guaranteed Viral Status Effect on damage tick. \nIncreased range from 15 meters to 20 meters (at max rank). \nIncreased duration from 3 to 5 seconds.\nMiasma inflicts double damage on targets affected by Spores. \nWhen recasting on the same enemy it will refresh the tick duration and maintain the Viral Status Effect, but will not stun enemies a second time until the Status Effect ticks have subsided.\nIncreased Saryn’s Armor from 175 to 225 (at rank 30)\nIncreased Saryn Prime’s Armor from 225 to 300 (at rank 30) \nMade some minor FX updates to Saryn’s abilities! \nSpores received a slight improvement to the FX.\nReduced the brightness of Miasma.\nImproved FX to make her Molt cast more pronounced.\nSpores have been optimized and will be much nicer to your CPU! \nSaryn is also coming with a whole new set of sounds voiced by [DE]Danielle!! \nAdded Abilities screen stats for Saryn Molt speed buff & duration.\nWe hope you enjoy experimenting with her changes. We will be watching closely for your first impressions. As always, we appreciate your constructive feedback and encourage you to thoroughly play with the rework before sharing your thoughts: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/957215-update-2220-saryn-revisted-20-feedback-megathread/\n\nIf you recall, we added enhanced Dojo Decorating earlier this year with some other minor changes. Part 2 has arrived, and it brings with it new visuals and a highly anticipated room!\n\nDisappearing platforms!\nDeadly frickin lasers and pressure-pads that you should avoid at all costs!\nDummies you need to kill to complete the course!\nAnd much more!\nAdded 37 Tenno Decorations and 54 Orokin Decorations for your Dojo renovating pleasure!\nAdded new Pigment colors dropped by the following enemies: \nShard Black: Vomvalysts \nTower White: Condrocs \nDevar Grey: Tusk Bombard \nWisp Grey: Skiff Pilot \nMortus Pink: Kuakas\nDid you miss our Dev Workshop!? Read it quickly here \nit's short:\n\nWe have added 'GPU Particles' which replace the no-longer-supported Nvidia PhysX Particles. These GPU Particles can be enjoyed on all Platforms with varying intensity:\nOff/Low/Medium/High... LUDICROUS!\nMany particle FX have been converted, but we will spend some time continuing to upgrade our catalog throughout the year. Our new system is universal, works on almost all GPUs (really old ones might be out of luck), is not locked to a given manufacturer, and is not locked to PC! Console Tenno will receive this next update!\n\nIf you watched Devstream 110, you might already be familiar with our plans to change the Scrambus and Comba. Players can now engage in more cerebral combat with these enemies, using visual cues to take them down:\n\nTheir Nullify aura has been replaced with a power that they can activate in combat. Upon use, it creates an expanding sphere that nuffilies players’ powers, and disrupts them for 2.5 seconds.\n \nSimilar to the way shooting the Nullifier bubble or weak point can interrupt or prevent the aura from spreading, shooting off Scrambus/Comba’s helmet (or killing them) will negate the sphere:\n\n\n\n\nWith today’s update, you are now able to acquire an active Dargyn in the following ways:\nShoot the Pilot, causing the Dargyn to float gracefully to the ground for you to board:\nUse Loki’s Switch Teleport on the Pilot, leaving him grounded and confused:\nUse a finisher from behind while using Archwing, allowing you to transition from Archwing to Dargyn:\nIn addition to this new mechanic, we have also made the following changes:\nIncreased mounted Dargyn projectile damage from 250 to 450 and increased the clip size from 50 to 75. \nIncreased the spawn frequency of Dargyn patrol and idle Dargyn encounters when roaming the Plains.\n\nImproved Defense Target navigation by shifting the path towards the center of level.\nBuilt additional buildings around the Defense Target path at both Defense locations.\nAdded additional enemy spawn locations for each Defense location, giving AI more of 360 degree attack option.\nAdjusted Turrets within the level.\nAdded additional cover and attack routes for AI.\nThe rail upon which the Defense Tram travels on is now electrified!\nMoved hack panels to easier-to-find places in certain Grineer Shipyard tilesets. Hopefully you won’t get caught in a lockdown, but if you do, it should be faster to find a panel!\nWe now show you what camera is being highlighted in Advanced Mode.\nAdded tool-tips to help you know what's going on with the settings! \nCaptura, Text, now, supports, commas,!\nImproved speed multiplier controls for controllers.\nFixed 'Cinematic Mode' button not re-appearing when swapping settings.\n\n\nThe improvements to Khora keep on coming! We have a number of important fixes that really help with making Khora play better, as well as some changes!\nChanges include:\n\nIncreased the range of Ensnare.\nRemoved the Line of Sight check from Ensnare to make it more reliable. \nRange Mods now affect Whipclaw's AoE radius, but it is capped. \nKhora's Whipclaw can now damage decorations (crates, barrels, etc).\nKhora's Kavat now teleports to a given target instead of pathing there if the target is too far away!\nChanged Khora’s Venari animations from domestic Kavat to Feral Kavat. \nAdjusted a number of Syandanas to fit Khora better.\nTweaked Venari command sounds.\nFixes include:\n\nFixed a weird 'foot shuffle' animation with Whipclaw. \nFixed using Khora’s Whipclaw on a target causing all enemies affected by Ensnare to be released when the target is killed while ensnared. This one was particularly nasty in practice and made her kit feel weak! \nFixed Khora’s Venari getting locked in her Attack Mode when attempting Mastery Rank tests, which can cause failure on stealth tests (MR9 for example). \nFixed infinite re-whipping for Khora's Whipclaw by flailing the camera around rapidly. \nFixed Ospreys not being fully disabled by Khora’s Ensnare.\nFixed Venari freezing in place when entering Cetus from the Plains, and subsequently duplicating if you head back out, eventually leading to a hall of kitty statues.\nReduced explosion radius from 6m to 4m .\nLowered the Tusk Bombard’s base health from 350 to 300.\nFixed smoke trail behind rocket to persist for life of projectile (trail was disappearing after 8s of flight time, making it very hard to see the rocket).\nReduced explosion radius from 10m to 4m.\nReduced lifetime of fire explosion FX from 10s to 7s.\nAdded a damage element to those fire FX \nMinor Heat damage and Heat proc if touched.\nFixed flame trail behind rocket to persist for life of projectile (trail was disappearing after 5s of flight time, making it very hard to see the Napalm).\nMelee attacks (including spin attacks) will no longer sweep through walls or objects. Please read our Dev Workshop for Melee insight!\nNumerous weapons have received the PBR treatment: \nFlux Rifle (original material and the Shock Camo Skin)\nLanka (original material and the Shock Camo Skin)\nGram\nKraken\nMarelok\nGrinlok\nKronen\nKarak\nTwin Gremlins\nBrakk\nSeer \nhas also receive a new scope FX!\nThe Ceramic Dagger has received a new look! Previously it was identical to the Cronus.\nMade nearly 10,000 micro-optimizations to hundreds of scripts including Warframe Powers, Precepts, Enemy Logic, Weapon Behaviors, Game-Modes, and the UI.\nHarrow’s Condemn, Thurible, and Gara’s Shattered Lash (stab) can now be used on ziplines. \nGara’s Splinter Storm now applies a HUD buff when cast on self to help manage when casting on many targets. \nOperators now emit pain grunts when experiencing fall damage.\nEidolon Lures will wait until the Eidolon has fully disappeared to be auto-destroyed, instead of being auto-destroyed when the sun rises at dawn.\nRemoved the ‘Related Items’ tab from Syndicate Offerings because of purchase attempts resulting in script errors. \nOpened even more previously locked treasure walls in the Void!\nYou now spawn in the Observatory upon returning to the Dojo after a mission.\nIncreased door opening speeds on the Grineer Settlement and Grineer Galleon Tilesets. \nPolished the animations of the Steel Meridian and Cephalon Suda Syndicate handshake emotes. \nReduced the frequency of large Grineer Settlement tiles appearing in Extermination missions to help them feel a little less long.\nRemoved legacy loot crates from Void Onslaught tiles that should not have been part of Simaris' simulation.\nIncreased time given by targets in the Round 11 Mastery Rank Test from 3.5 seconds to 5 seconds and added aim assist to targets to make them slightly easier to hit. \nTurned down volume of bullet impacts on player’s Flesh and Shields.\nChanged the “Dead End” message that appears when viewing a Dojo expansion doorway upon hitting the room limit to say “Maximum Room Count Reached”.\nCrouching is now stateful! If you let go of crouch while in a small tunnel, your Warframe will now stand up when it can.You can also now  crouch while parrying.\nUpdated the ambience in the Simulacrum by removing the repeating music loops.\nRevised and improved several Rock and Cave materials and meshes. \nQuality of life changes for Grineer cell doors in Rescue missions.\nChanged the marker on the panel used to move the tram in one of the Grineer Asteroid tiles to use a different icon so it can’t be confused with the main yellow diamond objective marker. \nDisabled Challenges in some quest missions (e.g. “use your first power 5 times”).\nSeveral Corpus Rescue mission Co-Op door improvements and fixes:\nChanged default state to locked where doors were closed to fix spawning issues.\nReplaced markers with new type.\nAdded state icons to all doors.\nAdded a new marker type on panels for consistency.\nAdded activation sound to door context actions.\nAligned door hint with the ground and changed widths to fit doors (some were too wide).\nRemoved panels from opposite side of the door since they're never accessible.\nShortened delay before the door opens when panels are activated.\nFixed context action alignment.\nFixed missing shiny 'destroy' material on consoles.\nFixed door closing after being opened.\nFixed materials on tram door so it doesn't look like a dead end.\nFixed some broken material script properties.\nPolished Harrow’s Idle animations and his Agile/Noble Speargun variant animations. \nUpdated several ability stat descriptors to make them clearer:\nStandardized format across all Warframe ability descriptions.\nE.g. Range (Meters) #  to Range #\nE.g. “Health over Time #” to “Health / Sec #”\nAdded units of measurement to the abilities where appropriate \nM (meters), S (seconds), % (percentage), X (multiplier), etc. \nConverted decimals to whole numbers (e.g. Equinox’s Rest & Rage Wakeup Health Threshold has been changed from 0.5 to 50% for max rank). \nChanged “Range” to “Radius” for several Warframe abilities.\nSyndicate Pickups are now auto-marked on the first pickup! \nRemoved erroneous stats from Sentinel UI (Energy and Sprint Speed).\nLotus is less chatty in Fissure missions! \nShortened and simplified most levels for the Vor's Prize missions, making sure the missions are more suitable for new player navigation. \nAdjusted the Mithra Syandana based on feedback. \nArcane ranks are now on the side of the icon rather than in the 'name' field.\nYou can now purchase multiple copies of Arcane Blueprints in Hok and Quills Offerings.\nIncreased the in-mission volume of Octavia's Horos Sound Pack by .5dB. \nTweaked the Nova Lamia Skin to better match the Steam Workshop images.\nTweaked the Skeiron Zephyr Skin to be more shiny and metallic instead of matte.\nTweaked the emissives of the Excalibur Sentient Slayer Skin.\nTweaked the Maltzur Oculus List Skin to improve the emissive details.\nUpdated naming filter to allow players to use appropriate words that contain inappropriate words, like “assassin”.\nUpdated chat profanity filter to catch profanity with punctuation immediately following it. Those of you who live on the edge and have the filter turned off won’t notice a thing, but there might be a few more asterisks and a few less inappropriate words in chat for our filtered Tenno. \nExodia Contagion’s Infested grenade 30 meter damage multiplier now also takes into account your combo multiplier.\nMoved the Earth Tikal node slightly to not overlap quest text.\nOnslaught mission Credits are now rewarded every 2 successful Zones. This eliminates being able to achieve free Credits in the initial spawn room by letting the timer run out.\nThe Mushussu Syandana is now animated!\nReplaced primary/secondary titles of Argonak fire modes with Semi and Auto.\nYou can now fast travel to ‘Navigation’ in the pause menu once you have your Observatory completed in the Dojo.\nTweaked Harrow’s Penance impact sound to have a less high frequency ringing.\nRepositioned the Simulacrums ‘Enemy Selector’, ‘Settings’ and ‘Kill Enemies’ buttons.\nChanged the Ghoul Purge World State Window text from \"Progress: (0 to 100)%\" to \"Ghoul Activity: (100 to 0)%\" to be more in line with other events.\nReduced the damage of Khora's Venari in Conclave.\nReduced the ammo pool of the Castanas family and Talons in Conclave. \nIncreased the effect of gravity on the Castanas family and Talons in Conclave. \nFixed a rare case where switching to another loadout in Conclave resulted in receiving no Affinity on that loadout if the mission ended before you respawned. \nFixed certain Conclave Mod buff indicators not being removed when damaged.\n",

For Khora and Venari have been detected in Simaris’ Sanctuary, and it’s his rules that are law there.\n\nA balanced Zaw Strike for Nikana and Staff weapons. A steady blade for steady hands.\nA heavy Zaw Strike for Machete and Hammer weapons. Measure twice, strike once... heavily.\nA light Zaw Strike for Scythe or Hammer weapons. Lightweight, for flash and bite.\nA two-handed Zaw Grip for measured strikes and greater impact.\nA one-handed Zaw Grip for measured strikes and greater impact.\nIn the simulated universe of the Sanctuary, my data-immortals have fought each other countless times. Through this violence, I have studied and documented their true character. But my study cannot be complete without the power of the Tenno, the most powerful specimen in the system  — you. Your duty in this experiment is to kill as many specimens as efficiently as possible.

  "changes": "Shrine Of The Eidolon: Update 22.16.0:\nFirst, it's worth mentioning this is largely rooted in improved functionality across the board. We do plan on releasing even more updates soon with further lighting improvements and the 'Build your Own Obstacle Course', so keep checking back for that.\nAnd now, the Remaster!\nWith this Remaster we've aimed to do a few things:\nGive you better decorating tools.\nOffer you more decorations.\nGive you more functionality in the Dojo.\n*Please note that the following items cannot be contributed to the Clan Vault:\nAll Articulas, Displays, and unique items (Neewa's Drawings, etc)\nAmbulas Noggle\nStalker Noggle\nShadow Debt Noggles (Acolytes)\nKuria Statuette\nSacred Vessel\nOro Ornament\nRell’s Donda\nProminence Wisp Totem\nThousand-Year Fish Statuette\nAyatan Sculptures \nwe know many of you enjoy creating monstrous creatures out of Ayatan, but we want to prevent any Endo tears from accidental non-refundable donations. Once everyone familiarizes themselves with this new 'Decorations in the Vault are permanent' we'll loosen this restriction.\nMission type and difficulty level\nPlanet and node\nOpen spots in your squad\nA whole new setting called Controller Interface now allows you to have the option of AutoDetect! AutoDetect will try to detect what you're using, when you use it. So if you prefer the drag-n-drop functionality of the Mods screen, you can keep using a mouse to do that and see the regular keyboard and mouse UI, however, when you next pick up a controller and press a button, the UI will detect that and refresh to show you controller button Icons instead.\nWithin the Controller Interface you can also permanently toggle on/off the controller interface, which forces the UI into either regular (keyboard and mouse) mode, or controller mode (this works separately from auto-detection and Steam Big Picture mode).\nLastly, you can now choose the UI Icon set under the new setting Controller Icon Set. You can choose between XB1, XB 360, PS4, Steam, and AutoDetect (AutoDetect is essentially XB1). However, using a Steam controller will always result in Steam Icons.\nImproved how precisely you can alter the Camera Duration slider (increment by 0.1 when using the arrow buttons next to the slider). This means that the minimum speed for Camera movements is now lower!\nImproved optimization of Advanced Captura Mode.\nThe playing Camera will now stop if you decide to edit a Camera Position while it's playing.\nImprovements for adding/removing Camera Positions while camera is playing in Captura.\nBrilliant/Radiant Shards are not removed from player inventory until the respective Eidolon spawns.\nPlayers can now remove their Shard after inserting it into the Shrine (until the Eidolon spawns, at which point it is removed from their inventories and consumed by the Shrine).\nAll Shards are removed from the Shrine and returned to Player inventories if a Host migration occurs before the Eidolon spawns.\nAll Shards are removed from the Shrine and returned to Player inventories if Night ends before the respective Eidolon spawns.\nAll Shards are removed from the Shrine and returned to Player inventories if players extract from that Plains before the Eidolon spawns.\nVomvalysts no longer drop Sentient Cores when they are auto-'killed' at sunrise. Unlike vampires, Vomvalysts are not killed by the sun, they just “go back to where they came from”.\nBased on feedback we are making some changes to the intensity of Visual Effects in Warframe, especially in the context of Eidolon fights!\n\nReduced some visual noise/lens flares on numerous Warframe abilities.\nReduced some visual noise/lens flares on the Operator Amp explosions/melee burst.\nGreatly toned down lens flare brightness and durations of Teralyst abilities (and variants)to help with visual clutter.\nImproved handling of rare cases of cache-corruption that would lead to crashes on startup.\nImproved hitbox sizes on the Eidolon Synovias (weak points) to make them easier to hit/target when moving.\nFixed an extra \"0\" damage number popping up for every instance of damage dealt to a Teralyst Synovia. Shotguns will therefore no longer shower the Teralyst with a confetti of zeroes when hitting a weak-point.\nBoltor Prime Status Chance increased from 32% to 34%.\nThe Shard selection screen will now show you how many Brilliant or Radiant Shards you have available to convert into Focus (originally this number would only be available to you once you had selected what Shard type you wanted to convert).\nReveal hidden contents\nOpened arbitrarily locked Void doors/walls that held Rare items. It’s been known for awhile now that the classic combination of Punch Through + Vacuum could grab these items for you, but now it’s open season for all!\nReduced the requirements for \"Kill X Dargyns with a Bow\" Riven challenge to bring the intended difficulty and time commitment in line with other Riven challenges.\nExisting Rivens with this challenge are unaffected\nFish Bait descriptions now also indicate what time of day that the respective fish will spawn. \nSlightly changed the color of each Fishing Spear to better identify which Spear you’re equipping.\nChanged the Fishing Spear Icons in Fisher Hai-Luk’s store to focus more on the Spear tip to better identify each Spear. \nYou can now search for Zaws in your Inventory via their Entitled name.\nUpdated the look of Nekros’ Shadows of the Dead minions to help players better differentiate between them and real enemies.\nUpdated the Verismo Syandana and Boltor Bravura Skin material to appear more metallic (for improved reflections and highlighting) to better match the Octavia Maestra Skin. \nA special UI message is now displayed when picking up a Syndicate Medallion or Cetus Wisp (similar to Argon Crystal). \nYou can now re-open the Ambulas boss doors from the outside if you’re an unlucky Tenno who got locked out of the arena cause your squad initiated the boss fight without you.\nImproved Archwing camera movements to clean up issues of janky jittering. \nRemoved the option to Install a Focus Lens on a Gilded Amp since a Rank 30 Amp is required for that action.\nChanged the Venomous Clip Archwing Mod to reflect the same Cost and Drain of other elemental Mods for Archwing.\nRemoved UI Buff indicators for Focus passives that are active 100% of the time with the exception of Vazarin’s Mending Soul. \nUpdated LOC for the \"Vigilante Fervor\" description to better describe what it does. \nAyatans (with the same type and socket layout) placed as Orbiter Decorations can now be placed back to back as per: https://twitter.com/PabloPoon/status/966762954338250752 \nInfested Ancients will now attempt to attack in more ways than just knockdowns and pulls when you’re within melee range. \nFailed Bounty squads will now be locked to prevent players from joining an already failed Bounty.\nImproved Sky Archwing banking movements to reduce doing so accidentally.\nYou can now shoot while initiating Afterburner in Sky Archwing. \nPlacing in the top 20 in a weekly Leaderboard with at least 50 entries will now show a notification about your placement!\nSentinels and their weapons will now display stats when Chat linked and viewed in the Codex.\nTennoGen items are now linkable in chat! \nNezha Dracun Skin default tints updated to lighten the dark tint and better match workshop images.\nTweaked the Mithra Mirage Skin colors to better reflect the Steam Workshop images.\nUpdated the Sarva Harness textures by request of the creator.\nIncreased the opening speed of doors in the Grineer Sealab tileset. \nRemoved the ability to purchase multiple of the same Helmet/Syandana from the Market. With the changes to how Arcanes are equipped, buying multiple of the same Helmet/Syandana is not necessary. \nUpdated the Vignette Bundle description to indicate it includes 2 Warframe Articulas.\nThe Market previews will now display your current equipped Warframe/Sentinel when viewing Armor Bundles. \nOperator Amps will now display their modular parts in the Operator Customization screen.\nImproved AI navigation in the Grineer Settlement tileset. \nImproved AI navigation in the Grineer Sealab Defense tileset.\nImproved AI navigation in the Grineer Galleon Survival tileset.\nImproved AI navigation in the Corpus Ice Planet Defense tileset.\nImproved AI navigation  in the Corpus Outpost Rescue tileset.\nImproved AI navigation and cover techniques in the Lua Defense tileset.\nUpdated all lowercase mentions of ‘Grineer’, ‘Corpus’ and ‘Warframe’ to be uniformly uppercase across the entire game in all languages.\nUpdated the Elite Frontier Lancer Codex image model.\nTweaked the glow FX on the Verismo Syandana. \nIncreased the number of items shown on the ‘Most Used’ list under your Profile & added the ability to scroll the list using your mouse. \nMade slight edits to the Mastery Rank up description so that it reads better.\nIncreased textbox width for Arcane text in Arcane Manager screen.\n",

Hopefully this is a much clearer representation of their Rarity than before: \nYou can now search/sort within the Arcane Manager screen.\nYou must be at least Mastery Rank 5 or have an Arcane owned if below Mastery Rank 5 to install an Arcane.\nFixed Beam weapons not being able to damage enemies (alive but in a ragdolled state) when being affected by certain ‘crowd control’ Abilities.\nDamage now ramps up over 0.6 seconds and after moving off target there is a delay of 0.8 seconds before it starts to decay over 2 seconds.\nAll Beam weapons now start their Damage ramp up at 20% (instead of 10%) with the following exceptions:\nConvectrix\nPrimary fire starts at 60%.\nAlt fire starts at 80%.\nPhage\nStarts at 70%.\nEmbolist\nStarts at 30%.\nThe Multishot chance should now apply more consistently with Beam weapons.\nWeapon Range Mods (like Sinister Reach) no longer affect the distance of chains for chainable Beam weapons (like the Amprex). Main Beam distance is still affected by them.\nFixed Beam weapons continuously firing when quick Meleeing.\nChain Range increased from 7.5m to 10m.\nDamage reduced from 24 to 22.\nRange increased from 20m to 24m.\nMag size decreased from 60 to 40.\nChain Range increased from 4m to 7m.\nIncreased Range from 20m to 27m.\nIncreased Damage from 18 to 20.\nTweaked Flux Rifle controller rumble on recharge.\nEndless Excavation missions now display ‘Digs Completed’ instead of ‘Total Cryotic Excavated’. The number of ‘Digs Completed’ is what counts towards the tiered Rewards in the Endless modes, and this change saves you some mental math! \nYou can still see the total Cryotic Excavated on the Mission Progress screen.\nUpon mounting a Dargyn, your Warframe will now become ‘invincible’ and enemies will attempt to destroy the Dargyn first instead of you.\nRemoved the ability to mount a Dargyn during Transference. Although this resulted in an amazing bug where a Warframe would fly away in the Dargyn and do work while you watched from your Operator on the ground, it’s not intended! \nRemoved dust FX on idling Dargyns.\nFixed not exiting Archwing mode when mounting and dismounting a Dargyn when Archwing is active.\nFixed being unable to place a waypoint when driving a Dargyn. \nFixed exiting a Dargyn

firing a Gunblade weapon (Sarpa, Redeemer, etc) resulting in the weapon no longer firing rounds and the firing audio being incorrect.\nMore fixes towards the Commander not spawning in Assassination Bounties.\nFixed enemies spawning on the wrong side of the portal in the final stage of The New Strange quest.\nFixed Mesa's Ballistic Battery ability's interaction with Beam weapons to behave like other weapon types: the Damage bonus is now only applied to one Damage hit, but it is not affected by the Beam weapon ramp-up and always applies full Damage.\nFixed Atlas’ Rubble not having any physics, which resulted in Rubble floating in the air if that Petrified enemy died there.\nFixed Ash’s Shuriken applying numerous Slash Status Effects to every enemy (even ones not hit) if in a group together (using Ferrox’s Alt Fire to group enemies closely). \nFixed Zephyr's Tornados remaining indefinitely if player goes into a bleedout and then self Revives.\nFixed markers for Lures and player placed markers sometimes being hidden when there's too many markers on screen.\nFixed Arcanes not listing Teralysts (+ variants) as drop locations, and vice versa. \nFixed Clients entering Archwing while quick-meleeing causing weapons locking up until animations are reset.\nFixed Teralyst fight session not locking after the first Synovia has been destroyed when not in the Teralyst Hunt Bounty.\nFixed instances where you shouldn’t have been able to use Transference.\nFixed spamming Transference at the Cetus gate turning you invincible. \nFixed potential script error when entering the

images appearing when hovering over Orokin Derelict nodes in the Star Chart.\nFixed AI getting stuck in a low ceiling area in the Grineer Forest tileset.\nFixed clipping of Corpus Gas City Defense tileset guns.\nFixed an escapable level hole in the Grineer Forest tileset as reported here:\nFixed incorrect values in the World State Window when exceeding your Simaris Synthesis Task.\nFixed

Clans. This screen was removed in preparation for the new Dark Sectors, and to help new players who were confused by what they were clicking on. You’ll have your time in the sun again, Taylor Swift.\n",

If a special animation is running when you enter the Appearance screen, it will continue until it's done and further special idle animations will not be played.\nRemoved the “while sliding” and “undetected” requirement for the \"Kill X Dargyns with a Bow\" Riven challenge to alleviate some frustrations.

  "changes": "Shrine Of The Eidolon: Hotfix 22.13.3:\nBeam Weapon behavior was originally changed to help with performance but as we've made optimizations to the game over time, we can return them to their original status of hitscan weapons with pinpoint accuracy and zero recoil. Or at least we think we can.\nPerfect accuracy and high fire rate is balanced by limited range and damage ramping up from 10% to 100% over 0.8 seconds when firing and decays back to 10% over 1 second after stopping. To help with ammo economy, Beam Weapons consume 0.5 ammo per trace \nunless they are Flamethrowers.\nOnce this launches (hopefully this week on PC), we're hoping for some practical feedback on the changes and your thoughts! It's a bit tricky to grasp the behaviour changes on paper, but in practice it's something you'll be able to detect quickly. Please bear that in mind when replying \npractical feedback will be the needle mover for any tweaks to come.\nWith such a huge change in behavior, comparing new stats with old is like apples to oranges so they are presented on their own below from our designer:\nBeam weapons now state \"STATUS\" instead of \"STATUS / SEC\" in the Arsenal because they can now Status Effect more than once per second (like all other weapons).\nThe Flux Rifle has a new battery charge up and fully charged sound to go with it’s beam rework!\nMinor tweaks to reload timing on Glaxion and Gammacor.\nTweaked the Synapse beam to better represent it’s Corrosive Damage.\nCurrently Multishot Mods do not increase Status chance. Multishot works like all other weapons except the affect is in the same spot as the base occurrence. We are monitoring this closely!\nCernos Prime Alt Fire is now silent as intended.\nIncreased the Fire Rate of the Zenith's Alt Fire.\nMade the additional projectiles of Talons and Castanas from Multishot spread in a more uniform/predictable pattern.\nEnabled weapon hit notifications for all projectile based weapons. A visual and audible example can be seen here from Devstream #106: https://clips.twitch.tv/GrotesqueElatedStingrayMcaT\nMap can now be panned halfway off screen\nWhen opening Advanced Map, the player position will be centered on the screen\nThe controller reticle will no longer be movable, instead the right analog stick will pan the Map around\nLeft analog stick now controls Map zoom\nPanning leeway will now scale with zoom level (so the Map can't be dragged far beyond the panning limit when zoomed in too much)\nIncreased the Endo awarded by Simaris’ Daily Synthesis Target by 2x.\nHold-to-Charge Abilities (Ember’s Fireball, Zephyr’s Tail Wind, etc) no longer auto cast when full. Cast now occurs on Charge release.\nAlso, if Energy drops below Charge cost, it will auto cast at the appropriate Charge level.\nCritical Chance, Critical Multiple, and Status Effect Chance now all apply to enemies inside Zephyr’s Tornado.\nLowered particle burst, opacity and particle count on numerous Gantulyst and Hydrolyst abilities in an attempt to alleviate performance issues and reduce visual clutter.\nLowered particle burst for Vomvalyst charge up attacks to alleviate performance issues.\nTweaked Kavat wall attack behaviours to prevent ‘supercat’. \nAdarza Kavat’s Cat’s Eye Critical Chance Buff no longer apply to Operators.\nSmeeta Kavat’s Charm Critical Chance and Energy recharge Buffs no longer apply to Operators.\nUpdated description of the Mod \"Entropy Burst\" to read \"Base Status Chance\" instead of \"Status Chance\".\nPicking up a Syndicate Medallion, Exceptional Sentient Core, or Flawless Sentient Core will now display the same special UI message like when you pick up an Argon Crystal.\nTalking to Onkko will now make all other Operators invisible, just like when you talk to Konzu with a busy crowd closeby. \nWhen customizing your Warframe under the Appearance tab, your Warframe will appear unarmed and idling to make customization easier without going into a blocking/armed stance. \nThe message that appears when you are over the Riven capacity limit will now have options to open the Dissolve screen, purchase Slots, or defer to later instead of having to go into the Dissolve screen first.\nCorrected a texture on the Repala Syandana to make it fully opaque instead of slightly transparent.\nTweaked the Saryn Nita’s Moda Skin to have a more pronounced ‘pulsating’ effect as requested by the creator.\nIgnis and Ignis Wraith are now usable in Conclave.\nFixed players not seeing the ‘killfeed’ when a player has been killed in Conclave.\nFixed not being able to equip the Knightess and Corpra Helmets in Conclave.\n",

  "changes": "Shrine Of The Eidolon: Update 22.12.0yup, Another Mainline!:\nTake your fight to the skies by hijacking unmanned Dargyns in the Plains. If you get caught, it's a footrace against the pilot to board the Dargyn! Use these to aid in your search for the new Eidolons!\n\n\n\n“The Sentient was a deformed creature, sent from some dark fold of distant space, crushing towers and citadels across Earth...”\nUntil meeting its fate in a climactic battle.\n“The device detonated. The Sentient's body shuddered, wracked by a cacophonous energy. Fragments of the Sentient crashed to the Plains and marshes and flatlands...”\nThese fragments are known as the Eidolons -\nmysterious titans that continue to wander the Plains and loom over the people of Cetus.\nMost of you have seen the Teralyst, a beast that rises from the watery depths every night. Legends speak of two more Eidolons that fell to the Plains, dormant for centuries but ever-present in the hearts and minds of the Ostrons.\nEidolon Hunters eager to prove their worth are trying to summon these creatures again. Are you worthy, Tenno?\n\nLegends say the Gantulyst wields an enormous boulder for an arm and radiates powerful beams of Sentient energy. The Ostrons built a shrine in its honor hoping to gain its favor.\n\nThe Ostrons believe the Hydrolyst is an omen of impending natural disaster. Stories describe a distinct, pungent aroma that precedes the arrival of this toxic beast.\n\n\nYou now have options to matchmake for Eidolon Hunts!\nIf you’re worthy, you’ll receive a guaranteed Riven Transmuter from the Hydrolyst (if captured). These consumable items can Transmute four Riven Mods into a brand-new Riven. Combining four Rivens of the same type (i.e Rifle, Melee, Shotgun, etc.) will result in a transmuted Riven of that type.\n\n\nEach Warframe’s stats and ability kits combine into a unique entity that offers different strengths and weaknesses. With 34 Warframes to choose from (and the 35th on the way), a Tenno may find there is no challenge they cannot overcome by making good use of the swiss army knife that their Arsenal offers. Some well-rounded frames do multiple things well, while others greatly excel in specific circumstances.\nWhen reviewing the Arsenal over time, our developers often find themselves asking: 'is this fun?’. That's the most important question to us, from the perspective of both the active player and their three squadmates. We understand the importance of power fantasy, but overbearing abilities can make squadmates feel ineffective by seriously disrupting intended gameplay flow. Conversely, when a Warframe doesn’t do enough, players may simply choose a “better” frame, sacrificing personalization and diversity for efficiency. Neither of these situations are ideal, so let’s shake things up!\nIf you've read the Dev Workshop, a lot of this will look familiar, but there are some minor changes! Our intent remains the same. We relist important information here because our Update notes are much more widely read than Dev Workshops.\nWe are revisiting all weapons and adjusting their stats to fit into some Mastery Rank grouping guidelines based on DPS and Crit/Status split total. With this in mind, we are buffing a lot of the weapons you know and love!\nAgain, a lot of this is as shown in the Dev Workshop, but our Update Notes are more widely read.\n\nSadly, not noted here are BEAM weapons \nthey should be ready soon, but we are revisiting them to be more 'like they used to be' in terms of damage instances over time but with a fixed fire rate. Fire Rate mods and their effects are still being determined. The Beam Weapon Category is simply not ready for this Update, but we are still working on it!\n\nConclave Weapon damage rebalancing has been done separately to account for the changes.\n\nWe calculate DPS based on sustained DPS which also takes Critical and Status values into account so our values may be different than yours!\n\nFor those of you in the Riven Market, please be aware these stats will not affect Riven dispositions. Player popularity / usage stats will continue to be the metric for that.\n\nOur data shows enemy weapons are unaffected by this, but if there are cases you believe to be wrong please note them in an appropriate subforum.\nWe sketched out Mastery Rank groupings of 0-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12 and 13-15 for each weapon type with a minimum DPS and amount split between crit and status for each group. Using existing stats, weapons were sorted into the groups. If their stats were too high for their current MR it was raised along with any other properties to match.\nIt's damage places it in MR 10-12 but it's crit and stat split is way too low. MR, status and critical chance is increased to match it's new MR. Increasing status and critical boosts its damage so its reduced down to fit back into the MR group guidelines its original stats dictated\nThe end result is the high performing/popular weapons stats remain untouched outside of being placed into their intended MR group and the rest of the weapons are brought up to equivalency.\n\nProjectile based and low fire rate weapons were given more crit and status allowance when appropriate.\n\nFree weapons like the Dex series have been given Mastery Rank values to match their stats! We know these are grandfathered in inventory regardless of Mastery Rank, it's just for consistency!\n\nSome outliers exist that either don’t meet or exceed their Mastery Rank's allotted DPS and \nCrit/Status split allowance because of additional properties and/or features.\nGrakata \nexceeds Crit/Status split but is extremely inaccurate\nStrun Wraith \nDPS is lower than  its Mastery Rank group but it has forced stagger on hit and high status chance\n\nIf players continue, they earn the credits reward, and the wager target is reset so that they have the opportunity to reach it again for more rewards. If players extract, the game ends and they collect all the rewards they managed to earn. The initial investment fee is only taken away once, regardless of the number of times the reward was earned. If time runs out and players are losing, they forfeit all rewards.\nRequired points per tier are now 50/75/100.\nIncreased the required Index points from 25/50/100 to 50/100/200\nEnemy levels scale half as fast.\nChanged the investment costs from 45k/60k/75k to 30k/40k/50k, and changed the credit returns from 120k/195k/275k to 105k/175k/250k. The amount of profit for each tier remains the same at 75k/135k/200k.\nChanged the rewards to give the total credit return and take away invested credits, instead of combining them into the net profit.\nIncreased Teralyst base level to 50.\nReduced base Armor and reduced base Health of Synovia weak points a bit.\nReduced damage of Teralyst abilities to reflect increased level.\nInverted the Shuffle state to be bright when it's enabled, and dark when disabled.\nResource Drop Chance Boosters now affect Mining and Fishing, doubling the chance to get gems and the base number of fish spawns! (Previously only regular Resource Boosters affected the Plains)\nPrime Vault Bounty Relics in Stage 1 have been moved to be rewarded in Stage 2 and weighted accordingly amongst the other Stages. It’s worth noting that Bounty Stage 5 now yields the highest chance of getting a Vaulted Relic. Our intentions here are to alleviate players abandoning the Bounty after the first Stage.\nResource Theft Incursion and Bounty stage (aka Armored Vault) in Plains now lasts only 2 minutes (was 3 minutes).\nIncreased amount of Lures allowed at once from 6 to 8. Lures that have not been hacked to Tenno faction now get destroyed when their camp is deactivated, freeing up room for a new Lure to spawn when players enter other camps.\nReplaced Relics rewarded from Ghouls with Prime Vault Relics (Lith G2 & Neo E1 replaced Lith T1 & Neo S7).\nFocus Passives now apply immediately upon loading into a mission rather than requiring the brief Operator transition.\nOperators can now interact with Pets on your Orbiter!\nReduced the delay between using a Gear item and spawning Archwing in the Plains.\nZaws and Operator Amps now have a stat in your Profile.\nMastery Rank eligible weapons now appear first with locked weapons appearing below when viewing weapons in the Market and Arsenal.\nPressing and holding the fire button on an automatic weapon during a dodge roll will now begin firing once the dodge roll is complete. It's now consistent with pressing and holding the fire button before doing the dodge roll.\nInterrupting an automatic weapon with quick melee will no longer require the player to press the trigger again; the weapon will now resume firing once the melee attack is done.\nUpdated the Dojo Research completion icon.\nTweaked Dojo Tenno Lab glass to fix bloom issues when using custom Dojo colors.\nWarframes in the Tenno Lab will now spin instead of standing still \nso fancy!\nImproved the coordination of rain and stormy skies in the Plains to fix rain appearing during a clear blue sky.\nReduced head bounce movement in Chroma’s sprint turns.\nForma/Forma Bundle prices in the Arsenal Upgrade screen will now display the discounted price if there's an active sale.\nRelay Chat tab now goes to the right of the squad tab.\nEidolon Vomvalyst Lures now have a new distinctive mesh!\nUpdated mastered icons in Inventory, they are now using the teal version rather than plain white.\nMastered icons now also appear on Blueprints in the Inventory for items that have been mastered.\nUpdated Grineer Settlement icon when used in the World State Window (old one was just a distant screencap of Phobos).\nLowered and reduced marker range for small elevators in Grineer Asteroid tiles.\nPurchasing a Slot or Orokin Catalyst in the Upgrade screen will now auto equip/install. This reduces the amount of prompts you have to go through to equip/install said items.\nHarrow’s emissives will now always be on so you don’t need Penance active to see Energy Colors.\nChroma can no longer jump or sprint when using Spectral Scream.\n\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed enemies not spawning if a Host Migration occurred. \nFixed Clients not being able to see/pick up the dropped Brilliant Eidolon Shard when a Host Migration occurred and no one had picked it up yet. \nMore fixes towards the gates to the Plains not opening. \nFixed the Operator Granmu Prism dealing more damage if you were a Client.

In that time, we will be closely monitoring how reproducible Performance issues may factor into this round and possibly revisit Relic placement. We do want to keep it the same on all Platforms so we'll need a bit of time to make changes.\nAll Bounties reward rotations from tiers 2 to 5 have a Vaulted Relic in it, and be sure to check our droprates site for the latest!\nUpdated textures to the Trinity Knightess Skin at the creator's request.\nImproved the lighting in the Market diorama.\nFollowers (Specters, Rescue Target, etc) no longer cancel charging if they switch targets while using a charging weapon.\n",

  "additions": "Added a reusable Blueprint for converting Intact Sentient Cores to Exceptional Sentient Cores. This Blueprint is available from Onkko in Cetus. This is an addition to help provide an alternative, but still invested, way for players to progress in the Quills. \nAdded back long lost functionality of showing 'Inspect Player' help text when looking at other Players in Relays/Cetus.\nThe Teralyst has a new purple shield bar that will appear overtop its health bar until depleted. This is to give players a better indication of how much shields it has left. \nWe now present players with the option to buy a Forma Bundle when using the Upgrade screen to install Forma. \nAdded filters to the Fish inventory screen at Fisher Hai-Luk's shop (Small, Medium, Large).\nAdded distinct icons for Elevator controls going up or down and increased the speed of some Elevators. \nYou can now decide to only allow friend invites from certain groups (All, Friends of Friends, etc). \nYou can now see how many of a given Mod you own if you click it through Chat Linking!\nAdded Time of Day text to the Free Roam node for the Plains of Eidolon!\nAdded Replay Quest option for A Man of Few Words. \nAdded Replay Quest option for Stolen Dreams. \nAdded a small delay when transitioning to jog from run after firing a weapon so you have time to play your fire animation. Before depending on the weapons refire wait time, you wouldn't have enough time to raise your arms so bullets sort of just shot out of your body.\nAdded separate category for Sentient and Eidolon kills in Profile stats. \nAdded each type of fish from the Plains in the Codex.\nAdded ‘Defend’ icons to Eidolon Lures in the Plains. This icon will change to blue (0, 219, 255 to be exact) when the Lure is fully charged.\nAdded options to Flip Horizontal and Vertical for artwork within the Display customization window.\nAdded 4 new Grineer Asteroid Capture/loot rooms, and a new Capture objective room.\nAdded a Settings options for enabling/disabling hit sounds. This will be a toggle that disables the function entirely (instead of just muting the mixer) to save performance when disabled.\nAdded a Kuva count label under the ‘confirm’ button when attempting to reroll a Riven to inform you of how much Kuva you currently have.\n",
  "changes": "Plains Of Eidolon: Update 22.10.0:\nDisclaimer:\nTenno! This Update brings you yet another Mainline! You may recall from the end of 2017 what that means... it could be a bit bumpy! We're standing by to fix any issues. The major reason for this mainline is that we've done a massive Code audit that touched almost 3000 different core engine files to better optimize Warframe. While this Update brings you some new fashion frame options for Mesa and 3 new Augments, the majority of this Update is focused on bringing fixes and Quality of Life changes. If that's not what you're after, we've got lots of great stuff coming very soon. The Plains are going to get a lot more dangerous at night in an upcoming Update.....\n\nYou can now damage Vay Hek up to 25% of his total Health (was 10% previously) while his Propaganda Drone is active before it shuts off. This will result in less waiting around, and will make Vay Hek in Terra Frame easier to deal with.\nReduced base Armor of Vay Hek in his Terra Frame from 225 to 200.\nGhoul Lore Fragments are simply way more likely to drop within Bounties now.\nGhoul enemies themselves can now also drop the Lore Fragments (and Ghouls always have a chance to appear outside of Ghoul Bounties!).  \nGhoul Bounty tables have received new items including Nitain, Cetus Wisps, and Breath of the Eidolon!\nEquinox's Night-Form 'Mend' now regenerates Shields of Allies as enemies are killed within range.\nIncreased the drop chance of Intact Sentient Cores from Vomvalysts to 100%.\nUpdated description of Kwath (Grip) to properly inform of its stats: \n\"Light weight\" now reads \"Heavy weight\"\n\"increase in speed\" now reads \"increase in damage\"\n\"cost of damage\" now reads \"cost of speed\".\nUpdated the description on Zaw balances to say \"link\" instead of \"counterweight\".\nRemoved the Mastery Rank 2 requirement from the MK1-Furis.\nUpdated the Design Council tips that appear in the loading screen and removed some that don’t apply anymore.\nBounties are now Mastery Rank tiered! In the current system, a player of any Mastery Rank could queue up and join any Bounty, even the highest level ones! In order to avoid a mismatch in experience, we've simply set each Bounty to have a default Mastery Rank. It looks a little something like this: \nWhen the Acolytes are live, players will only see them in the World State panel once they've completed Vor's Prize.\nEidolon Lures now follow both Warframe or Operator rather than just the Warframe. The Lure will also now teleport to the player it’s following if/when it gets too far away/stuck. \nWarframe Specters are now much smarter! If you don't recall, Specters are craftable gear you can equip to summon an AI companion in battle. We've done a general intelligence pass on their proficiency with Weapons, and we've also updated their power-casting logic. Virtually every power is now castable with only a few exceptions! Specters CANNOT cast the following Abilities: Vauban's Minelayer, Ivara's Zipline, Titania's Razorwing, Nekros’ Desecrate and Shadows of the Dead, Excalibur’s Exalted Blade, Valkyr’s Hysteria, Wukong’s Primal Fury, Cloud Walker, and Defy, Atlas’ Petrify and Tectonics, Limbo's entire kit (save for the damage aspect of Banish), and finally Zephyr’s Dive Bomb. \nSecurity cameras now trigger more intelligently, the Corpus have upgraded their software. \nImproved the UI on Defection missions by having instruction text, aligning objectives, and better colour coding for defector icons. \nIncreased duration of Duality Augment to be 10 seconds at Max Rank (affected by Duration Mods).\nSecond Dream now has two vaults instead of three during the first Spy mission.  \nDisabled Stalker, Arc traps, and random transmissions during some quest missions. \nUpdated some doors which still had red non-interactive locked materials to new off versions. \nInstead of redundantly showing both Fire Rate and Charge Rate on bows, they now hide Fire Rate unless comparing to a non-bow weapon. \nChanged the background on selected Tenno customizations to be the same white as when selecting customizations from the Arsenal. \nImproved Sprint/Toggle Sprint so that sprinting stops less often. \nStanding in place with sprint key down no longer causes the sprint posture (for the purposes of Prowl and such).\nWhen a player tries to sell their last Sentinel, a more informative message will appear to explain why it cannot be sold. \nSomachord now continues playing where you left off when you return to your Orbiter.\nSomachord Tones now have their own marker icon when waypointing/finding one in a mission.\nRemoved the \"kill unalerted enemies\" or \"hack 1 terminal\" Challenges from The Law of Retribution and The Jordas Verdict.\nThe War Within Choice Scene has been changed to be untradable.\nTweaked the Cryona Syandana default Tint colors to better match the original Steam Workshop image. \nIncreased the Health of the Loki Specter in the Neptune Junction on Uranus.\nRemoved the equip sound from the Fishing Spear.\nChanged the 'disable sniper scopes' HUD option to be 'use sniper scopes' instead to fit with the positive style of other option wordings.\nIncreased follow radius of Drone in the Drone Hijack Incursion from 30m to 50m.\nLowered health of Grineer Auto Turrets from 1250 to 1100. \nLowered health from 650 to 550 and armor from 100 to 75 of the big Dropship Turret.\nTweaked wording/order in the Landing Craft menu:\nRenamed ‘PLACE DECORATIONS’ to ‘DECORATE’\nRenamed ‘CUSTOMIZE INTERIOR’ to ‘INTERIOR COLORS’\nFlipped the order of those two options\nNox enemies will now react when being damaged by a Stealth attack. Before they would remain not alerted after taking some stealthy damage.\nOperators will now automatically go back into Void Mode after a Void Blast if crouch is still being held (and they have enough Energy).\nReplaced old damaged Liset ship in Vor’s Prize cinematic with new damaged version.\nSabotage missions on Settlement, Shipyards, and Gas City tilesets now have 2 stages.\nThe Arca Plasmor received a change yesterday where headshots no longer deal bonus damage. The Arca Plasmor was designed to hit multiple targets with a high-status chance, but with wide wave projectiles and inherent punch-through, a single shot could result in multiple headshots. With it being a shotgun, it was never intended to behave as a precision weapon, and the bonus pushed it too far out of that mold.\nHowever! While this has changed, headshots should still deal damage (without the multiplier). Currently, there is a bug where headshots deal absolutely 0 damage. This is obviously not intended, and we are working on a fix to resolve this issue.    \nWe apologize for missing this in the original version of the update notes for 22.10.0! As we’ve mentioned before, mainline updates can be a bit rocky (last night’s 4 a.m. ET hotfix for example). Thank you for your understanding.\nConclave Stance Fateful Truth Leading Blade combo now only hits once during the dash.\nConclave Stance Fateful Truth Sudden Spring combo damage reduced.\n",

Does this bring it back to its skyrocketing ways? No. But now it has an appropriate amount of ‘oomph’ that doesn’t send you across the map to collect your dropped goodies.\nIncreased the size while wielded.\nAdded 0.5m Punch Through.\nAdded Ragdoll on Death.\n",

We do not want to ship something that we are unable to Hotfix for more than a week.\nWe have plans to make 2018 kickoff with long overdue reviews. Enjoy your holidays with some new gear and more while we enjoy ours, and we'll return in 2018 well rested and ready to rock!\nFragments in your Codex are now categorized based on their origin (Cephalon, Cetus, Gara, and Ghouls).  \nYou can now replay Bounties for Standing!\nYou can now use Emotes in your Orbiter! Deep bows all around.\nMirage's Hall of Mirrors casting animation has been changed to match the style of the Mirage Prime trailer! \nRemoved reticle animation when sprinting due to feedback. \nImproved sound ambience and performance on a Grineer Settlement tileset door. \nThe body tendrils on Nezha’s Yaksha Tennogen Skin is now tintable and will take tints from the tertiary slot. \nLieutenant Lech Kril changes: \nLech Kril will now prioritize using his ice abilities instead of melee when he can.\nUpon destroying Lech Kril's backpack, his ice abilities will have their cooldowns reset to reduce time spent waiting around.\nChanged Lech Kril's Ice Wave ability so that it doesn’t halt the fight when players are meleeing him. \nAdded FX to Lech Kril's weakspot that changes tint based on how much damage his backpack has taken to help make the objective clearer to new player. \nVery slightly tweaked hitbox location for backpack to try and achieve more consistent damage. \nWhen Decorating your Dojo, your selected Decoration will now be deselected if you type into the search bar and the Decoration in question does not appear on the results page. This should help prevent players accidentally building the wrong item!\nAmbulas is now immune to Viral Damage. This will fix issues where Ambulas becomes unhackable.\nReset Dynamic Resolution back to off by default because on some systems it seems to malfunction.\n",

As with all Ghouls, no regard is given to the proper development of its higher functions. Cantilevered leg augments propel the unit toward the fray at speed, while over\nand under-mounted extendable drill carriages magnify both reach and penetrating power.\nGHOUL AUGER ALPHA \nWhether through aberrant cognition or sheer brutality one specimen always moves to the front of each pack. It is from this individual that the other units take their lead. \n  \nGHOUL DEVOURER \nVay Hek's personal favorite, the Devourer is a maximal terror unit. Draped in shreds of the diapause bag that birthed it, this gap-mawed monstrosity barrels toward prey with furious intensity. Wrist-mounted hooks are welded to elbow joints and hyperpowered by a myotechnological winch system for maximum impact-and-pull.\nGHOUL EXPIRED \nThe Expired are Ghouls who have succumbed to malnutrition or environmental poisoning during the early stages of development. Their backup nervous systems continue to drive them forward, however, making them ideal suicide troops.\nGHOUL EXPIRED DESERTER \nWhy this emaciated monstrosity chose to abandon its pack remains to be seen.\nGHOUL RICTUS \nSo named for its terrifying leer, the Rictus (AKA 'the Sawman') lives to divide and conquer its foes \nliterally. \n  \nGHOUL RICTUS ALPHA \nThis specimen shows evidence of advanced cognitive abilities and greater, if rudimentary, situational analysis.

These currently unreleased changes (discussed in Devstream #103) will include grid snapping, placing floating decorations, and much more!\nWarframe Articula: Posable scale models of your favorite Warframes are here! To place, open your decoration tool and select “Warframe Articula”. Once you’ve found the perfect spot, customize by selecting from your existing loadouts, choosing a pose from the “Warframe Gun Pose Set”, and swapping weapons!

For example, you won’t be able to place a large number of Articula like you can with Noggles.\nTrees, Planters and more!\nExplore a new line of decorations including some plants and decorative toys for your Companions!\nThere is a new Operator customization option available: School specific animations! \nZenurik, Naramon, Unairu, Madurai, and Vazarin have their own set of idle animations. These are freely for the school of your choice.

  "changes": "Plains Of Eidolon: Update 22.6.0:\nTenno!\nWe’re bringing you what we call a “mainline” update today. This is every fix and QoL change we have been working on since October in addition to content drops. 22.6.0 sets the stage for a bigger end of year Update that includes Khora and more!\nIt’s important to note that sometimes mainline updates can be rocky since they have deep overhauls for optimization within.\nWe will be actively watching for bugs and your feedback on the additions and changes below!\nThe Plains of Eidolon now have changing weather patterns! This new dynamic weather system brings rain, lightning, rolling thunder, as well as fluctuating wind and cloud patterns. The Plains can shift from sunshine to rain (and vice versa) during the day and night, and rain will linger for a reasonable amount of time.\nJumping in puddles isn’t the only good thing about being out in the Plains during the rain! Take advantage of increased fish spawns and reduced visibility for the Grineer while it is raining.\nA rain slider has also been added to the Plains of Eidolon Captura Scene. Adjust the slider from a light trickle to total downpour and capture your dramatic side!\nSince the launch of Focus 2.0 in Update 22: Plains of Eidolon, you have shared your thoughts and suggestions on where we could improve on Operator gameplay as a whole. Focus 2.5 is a reflection of what we’ve learned through your experiences, and acts as a jumping-off point for future implementations that need more consideration before they reach you (daily cap removal for example).\nBelow you will find a breakdown of what has changed in Focus 2.5. If you would like to read more about our intent and motivation for these changes, and some of our future plans for Operator gameplay, head on over to “The Features of Focus 2.5” Dev Workshop thread .\nWe have added shared pool capacity! You can now upgrade your pool size using the points from any School you wish, which increases the maximum capacity for every school all at once.\nYou can increase pool capacity from your active tree. Simply select a School of choice as your “primary” and use its Focus points to increase the shared pool capacity.\nThe ability to increase capacity from within the tree itself still exists, but these points will contribute to the shared pool instead.\nThe costs of unlocking nodes across all trees have, on average, been reduced by almost 30%. The table below compares what a 5 rank passive node (like Zenurik’s Energy Pulse) costs before and after these changes:\n\nVoid Singularity’s pull speed has been doubled.  \nLightning Dash now costs 10 energy per cast.\nGuardian Blast now grants 160 shields at max, up from 100.\nProtective Dash now grants 5s of immunity at max, up from 2s.\nVoid Spines now reflects 100% damage at max, up from 25%.\nStone Skin now adds flat armor, 60 for both Warframe and Operator at max.\nVoid Strike now continues accumulating damage boosts over multiple uses of void mode, each rank adds additional attacks up to a max of 8.\nBlazing Dash now stuns enemies instead of ragdolling.\nWe are excited to see how you feel about these changes, and will be collecting your feedback on Focus 2.5 changes in the dev workshop we posted earlier this week.\nThe following Incursions can now occur in Caves scattered around the Plains: Exterminate, Assassinate, and Cache Recovery. The objectives in these Incursions are the same as they are in the Plains, but there is now a chance for these to randomly take place in caves!\nThe intent of the following changes is to make fishing a more harmonious experience for you and your squad! Until now, Bait, Dye, and Pharoma has only exclusively affected the player who used it. Moving forward, all squadmates will receive benefits from Bait or other fishing consumables in the Plains. The fish you see will still vary from player to player, however, the effects of these consumables will be shared across all members.\nWhen making this change, we also reviewed how each of these consumables worked and tweaked them slightly for the sake of consistency and balance:\nYou can now throw Pharoma and Luminous Dye like Bait!*\nDye, Pharoma and Bait now only work within a certain radius around its casting point. Any player fishing within the radius around this casting point will benefit from its effects.\n*In order for Luminous Dye and Pharoma to work within this system, they are now thrown like bait. They float in the water and affect all fish in the same body of water within a certain radius. This way you can cast out the Dye in one place, and all players will see the fish get highlighted as they swim near it. Multiple Dyes can be used at once, if you want to affect a larger section of the water.\nFinally, we made the following changes and fixes to fishing:\nAdded custom Bait throwing animation.\nActive Bait will no longer be destroyed by fish.\nReduced fish escape speed when spooked.\nFixes towards fish swimming through terrain.\nFixed rare case where fishing Bait would not float properly.\nFixes towards Bait being destroyed if thrown into shallow ponds where the bait would hit the bottom before floating to the surface.\nFixed clients being able to throw one more Bait than they actually have.\nFixed an issue where some fish could swim in the air.\nMass Vitrify is no longer invulnerable and now has sections that break off and explode as it absorbs incoming damage. The amount of damage absorbed scales with Power Strength and Armor. Explosion damage scales with Power Strength. \nMass Vitrify no longer has a duration and remains until recast, destroyed from damage, or smashed with Shattered Lash.\nGara is still relatively new as far as Warframes are concerned but since her release, we’ve found (and many players have found) that an invulnerable and almost impenetrable barrier doesn’t allow for a very engaging gameplay experience. We know that other Warframes also have Powers with similar issues, but adding a shattering component to Mass Vitrify is a change we could easily implement that is consistent with Gara’s glass theme while also making Mass Vitrify more interactive.\nWith these new changes, we can tweak the absorption and explosion values as necessary to make sure Mass Vitrify is both fun and effective. Please keep your feedback constructive and let us know what you think after you’ve had a chance to test these new changes.\nReduced Electric Shield’s Energy Cost per meter to 1 Energy per 4 meters (down from 1 per 1 meter)\nWe previously announced changes to Discharge in this thread. But after further testing, we found that the changes were a lot more powerful than anticipated (we’ve included a video below). As a result, Discharge has not been changed yet. We will continue to work on Discharge improvements before releasing them in a future update. Sorry for getting anyone excited prematurely for Discharge! We appreciate your patience.\nPreviously proposed Discharge changes that ended up with more extreme crowd control than expected \nmodded here for extended range and lower damage. (not live!):\nSpoiler\nReticle will turn blue when targeting allies and red when targeting enemies.\nReticle will show different states for hip, aim and sprint.\nContext actions will dim when aiming while they are active.\nAll non-endless Solar Map and quest missions now display short objective instructions for each stage with a matching marker icon in the UI, similar to those displayed on the Plains.. Some endless missions also have new objective text. \nSimplified and cleaned up any existing objective UI's general alignment, ordering and spacing to make it more readable. \nReworded language in some existing missions’ objective UI for clarity, and added more appropriate text to some timers instead of the generic 'Time'.\nFixed many small consistency issues and bugs with objective markers and replaced some existing mission markers with area markers where appropriate.\nAdded area markers to Hive missions to cover highlight areas where the destroyable tumor nodes spawned around each hive.\nDuring long dialog stages in quests, there will now always be an area marker so that players don't get confused about where they should be.\nChanged timer description in Rescue missions to “Time Limit” instead of “Time Left”. \nIn-world markers for Incursion/Bounty objectives locations will no longer disappear for others when someone reaches it first \nit will persist for players who aren't in the area yet. \nIn-world markers for Incursion/Bounty objectives will reappear if you leave the objective area.\nThe countdown timer when leaving the perimeters of an objective in the Plains has moved to a more visible spot in the UI. It also states that you are “abandoning objective”. \nChanged the marker for downed Capture targets from red to a yellow objective marker \nthis will make it clearer to players that they need to use the context action instead of continuing to damage the target.\nObjective timers are now greyed out when paused.\n'Get to extraction' objective appears on the UI when extraction is enabled (excludes missions where extraction is optional).\nExtraction Timer text changed from 'Time:' to 'Extracting In:' so it can't be confused with other active timers.\nSome missions with large extraction zones like landing pads now use a green area extraction marker. Adjusted some extraction zones so that they fill the whole landing pad and marker area, instead of half of a landing pad.\nRemoved panels from Corpus doors which never did anything to avoid new player confusion because they would light up during lockdowns.\nFixed missing markers on Corpus co-op doors.\nThe Rescue Target in the Plains now has a HUD health indicator located under your mini-map.  \nFixed objective waypoint not disappearing after successfully destroying the Reactor in Sabotage missions.\nFixed Bounty waypoint directing players to extraction when Archwing is immediately deployed upon entering the Plains. \nFixed objective waypoint not disappearing after successfully taking the Vessel from the tomb in the last mission of the Sands of Inaros Quest.\nFixed some Markers being stuck in the at origin on the minimap. \nFixed unlocked icon appearing very dimly on Grineer doors.\nMade performance and memory optimizations to the Plains of Eidolon and other tilesets. If you were experiencing crashes before, we hope that these changes will be the fix!\nThe Corpus Gas City and Grineer Settlement tilesets have received an audio remaster! We revised the sounds in these tiles and used updated engine tech so that certain ambient sounds are more noticeable and clear. The remaster adds more character and personality to the audio and will also make enemies easier to pick out. \nTime between Incursions will increase if you let an Incursion alert expire. The Lotus can take a hint!\nA single Vomvalyst in its energy-form near multiple Lures will now only feed a charge to a single Lure. However, to improve overall survivability of the Lures, we have changed Eidolon Lures to always spawn at level 30 regardless of Bounty level or distance from the gate.\nHunter Command Mod change: your Companion will now focus on an enemy for a set duration when they are first slash proc’d by you. While focused on a target, they will ignore any other newly proc’d enemies and will go back to their default behavior after the duration expires.\nOperators and Ostron Vendors in Cetus have had their eyes beautified with shaders.\nThe beams from Trinity’s Link now fade out when the Ability has ended.\nLephantis’ melee attacks will now knock you back if you’re hit!\nSmoothed NPC movement for clients with a poor connection to host.\nReplaced an old version of the reactor in Grineer Settlement Sabotage with the newer (and fewer-pronged) version used in the Grineer Shipyard Tileset. \nRemoved blue undertone from Nekros Irkalla’s energy wisps.\nImproved AI pathing in the Grineer Asteroid tileset. \nOverall UI optimizations. \nReduced number of stasis mines in Archwing Rush.\nAdded 'destroyable' shine FX to mines in Archwing Rush. \nA Skiff VIP has been added to the list of commanders in Dynamic Assassinate Incursions.\nImproving the responsiveness of loadouts in Relays and Cetus. \nMade improvements towards less hitches in Relays.\nImproved AI pathing on the Grineer Settlement tileset. \nAudio will now properly resume if your audio device is disconnected and then reconnected. \nGrineer Melee enemies on the Plains are now able to climb to the top of the Storage Containers.  \nTuned down the bloom on the wings of the Chroma Vojnik Battle-Damaged Tennogen Skin.\nImproved lighting on the Lua tileset doors. \nChanged “enemies are dead” transmission to “broken their ranks” transmission in Invasion missions. \nUpdated one of Lotus’ lines for the Mastery Rank 25 test to better match the test.\n",

We hope these further changes do just that.\nTweaked Hallowed Ground FX to reduce performance issues.\nRange Mods now apply 75% to Range (distance from Oberon) and 75% to Arc Angle of Hallowed Ground (before was 25% to Range and 75% to Arc before).\nOberon’s Renewal now heals friendly summoned units (IE Nekros’ Shadows of the Dead) at 1/3 the rate but consumes 1/3 the Energy drain for doing so. The change to have Renewal not affect friendly summons was met with varying opinions, and is now further tweaked to meet a happy middle ground. \nOberon’s Renewal Armor buff will be applied to allies anytime they step on Hallowed Ground while Renewal is active on them as opposed to them having to be on Hallowed Ground when Renewal hits them.\nRenewal no longer affects Nidus’ Maggots as to not prevent them from exploding (their intended behavior).\nOberon’s Reckoning Armor debuff is now based on the target's base Armor instead of current Armor (meaning no more diminishing returns).\nPull, Magnetize, and Polarize can now be cast while in motion \ntheir animations now only take place on the upper body. \nRemoved the .75 second delay at the end of Mag’s Crush cast.\nEximus units can now be summoned as Inaros’ Sand Shadows. \nTweaked the Endura Idle FX to better display ‘leafy particles’. \nSaved 10MB of RAM and reduced update and startup time for players that installed from Steam or used the Offline-Installer.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed being unable to craft the Destreza. This also fixes other items requiring Argon Crystals not being craftable. \nFixed crashing or failing to join when using the /join command to enter a player's mission.\nFixed crashing when attempting to enter the Dojo.\nFixed extracting as the Operator not applying Boosters to obtained Kuva.\nFixed a script error when attempting to Randomize your Warframe appearance in the Arsenal.\nFixed retaining the Fissure Primary Weapon buff permanently with Ivara’s Artemis Bow.\nFixed the Nidina Armor not properly applying chosen Energy color. \nFixed the Nidina Armor clipping into Frost/Frost Prime and his Skins.\nFixed some texture issues on the Ivara Youkai Skin. \nFixed some texture issues on the Repala Syandana. \nFixed seeing an empty screen when attempting to place a Decoration in the Obstacle Course. It’s fully intentional that Decorations are not placeable in the Obstacle Course, but the empty screen was not intended to appear.\nFixed underlying/default node's requirements being checked when taxiing to a Sortie mission (ie Kela's Judgement Points).\nFixed being unable to select a Relic in an Endless Fissure mission if a Relic was not brought in the mission from the start.\nFixed Hosts seeing Clients firing multiple bullets when they only fired one. \nFixed some Pistols having a weird left hand movement when firing.\n",

This means Low/Medium/High wager players will not be matchmade together \nyou'll only be put with others that have chosen the same wager. This should mitigate conflicting goals within a Squad.\nWe have made some tweaks to last week's reinforcement: the Cycron! If you haven't picked this up yet yourself, the Cycron doesn't have a reload function; it has a recharge function. As of this Update, the Cycron battery recharge delay time is now halved when the mag is not empty. This means monitoring your ammo while feathering the trigger will be a good strategy when using this weapon. \nWe have made some tweaks to older Warframe Auras. As you may know, an Aura's Mod Rank determines how much additional Mod Capacity you get. We've increased the following Auras form 3 Ranks to 5 Ranks.

With the damage of Smite scaled into its projectiles, this will give Smite more punch when facing lower level enemies.\nOberon’s ability to keep himself and his teammates alive is a large part of his overall role. Feedback brought forth further tweaks with the intention to solidify this role.\nRemoved Heal Time from Renewal. Renewal now functions more conventionally as a toggle which drains 2 Energy per second while active + 3 Energy per second per target actively being healed. *Please note that Trinity's Energy Vampire will not give Oberon Energy while Renewal is active.\nAdded the \"is active\" ability icon animation to Renewal.\nFixed Renewal bleedout buff being removed when entering bleedout.\nFixed Hallowed Ground being impossible to see with low particle quality setting. *Please note we are still working on Hallowed Ground FX improvements overall.\nFixed a script error with Hallowed Eruption Augment upon deactivating while another Oberon has Hallowed Ground active, resulting in the FX to remain forever.\nFixed Hallowed Ground & Hallowed Eruption Augment not hurting ragdolled enemies.\nFixed a The War Within progression stopping issue that was caused by missing transmissions. \nFixed Ratels being immune to certain Warframe abilities. \nFixed Nullifier bubbles for Clients getting created 2-3s after it is created for the Host leading to issues as described here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/67szr3/heads_up_nullifier_bubble_seems_to_not_taking/ .\nFixed a script error for Clients when a Nullifier spawns his bubble which also fixes the above. \nFixed the Magnum Force Mod having 2 Accuracy stats in the description.\nFixed Clients sometimes not seeing Defense/Rescue target Health bars.\nFixed an unbreakable bar in the Grineer fans that wasn’t being destroyed if the Client only damaged the fan blade as seen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/67pu8z/hey_de_pretty_please_can_you_remove_this_annoying/.\nFixed scaling the Chat window now preserving the position relative to the size of the screen. \nFixed the Lucra Syandana displaying low quality Corpus text.\nFixed Syandana collision issues on numerous TennoGen/Deluxe Skins and Prime variants.\nFixed markers and names appearing in front of the Void Relic selection screen instead of behind during an Endless Void Fissure mission. \nFixed performing Melee attacks as you are being staggered causing the animation to replay once you recover.\nFixed melee weapon light flickering on and off and appearing to have a hard edge when near grass in the Grineer Earth tileset. \nFixed some weapon trail placements on the Fang and Dual Skanas.\nFixed a deadlock that could occur when aborting the content update process on a fast network and a slow hard-drive.\nFixed the ‘Mastery Locked’ text being occluded by the weapon icon. \nFixing Octavia's Mallet looking solid in Dx9. \nFixed a script error with the Harpak’s Alt Fire.\n",

Ammo is now automatically refilled when you run out so you can reload clips.\nOptimized memory use when viewing Clan statistics; in bad cases this could use enough memory to crash 32-bit systems.\nLots of various sound tweaks to Corpus enemy types.\nWeapons that use Batteries as clips will now be affected by Reload Speed Mods.\nArchwing weapons will now display the correct Recharge delay time as Reload in the Arsenal as opposed to some value which has no effect on the weapon.\nArchwing weapons will no longer reset Recharge delay upon firing an empty clip.\nKuva Siphon missions must now be fully completed to earn any Kuva from it.\n",

If you are an avid Chroma user, you probably know the power maximizing this ability brings. At some point in Chroma's future we will need to revisit and use ideal methods for his Abilities; we will inform you well in advance when Chroma is under review. As you may or may not know, Oberon is currently under review at this time!\nUpdated the Ability screen and HUD buff numbers to be consistent with other powers. Functionally they remain exactly the same; they just start at 0% instead of 100%.\n\nCataclysm now deals different amount of damage over the time it exists: 25% Damage when bubble is full size, 100% at its smallest size.\nCataclysm damage scaling now uses average Health + Shield instead of total Health + Shield of enemies within.\n\nNyx's Assimilate Augment for Absorb no longer Absorbs Friendly Fire.\n\nFixed a bug that would cause Banshee's Silence to last longer depending on your frame-rate (approximately 5% longer at 60 FPS, 30% longer at 30 FPS).\nBuffed Silence's base Duration to 10/15/20/30 (20% at max rank) which now matches Sonar so you can cast them in tandem.\n\nTrading Platinum while having free Platinum will now display a tip that free Platinum cannot be traded.\nCompanion silhouettes no longer show in Captura.\nFriendly Archwing markers, Atlas, Rhino, Valkyr’s custom HUD and Inaros’ resurrect HUD are now affected by the HUD scaling sliders in the Interface options.\nMoved a Kuria to a reachable area in the Grineer Shipyard tileset.\nTweaked the Synoid Gammacor's force feedback to be more consistent when using a controller.\nReduced the Rift Stasis weight of the Mutalist Quanta stackable projectile.\nRemoved the ability to friend yourself.\nRemoved the settings buttons on the lower right screen when adjusting the HUD margins.

We now have added a final confirmation dialogue for a trade that lists the items being traded and requiring a final confirmation from both sides. i.e. \"You are about to trade an Unranked Prime Chamber for 1000 Platinum?\" and confirmation by button press or mouse click from both sides before \"Trade Completed\". This is one last review of the manifest to ensure you're certain of your trade.\nAdded the ability to click on items in a Player’s Trade Menu, opening another screen with more details (much like clicking on a Linked item in Chat). \nBy typing /join [name of player] into Chat, you can attempt to join their lobby if no restrictions are in place (Solo, etc).\nAdded blur to offered item background in trade window to help with readability.\nDisposition is now displayed as dots from 1 to 5.

This change also allows a more accurate rating, with five possibilities instead of the previous three. A weapon’s Disposition can be seen in the Arsenal under the “Upgrade” section.\nPlayers on 3, 6, 9 and 12 Kill Streaks are now marked with Tenno Script chevrons.

  "changes": "Octavia'S Anthem: Update 20:\n\n\nDo you hear the music, Tenno? Faint memories of the Mandachord orchestra linger, and Suda wishes you follow it. Do as the Cephalon requests and be rewarded knowledge of an instrument from another time, the Mandachord. But, take caution... following her instructions may lead you down a twisted path...\nVisit the Cephalon Suda Enclave in the Relay, and speak to Suda to start the quest. You must have the Second Dream quest completed to do so.\nOctavia’s Anthem is a replayable quest! If you would like to experience it again, visit your Codex and select “Replay Quest”.\n\n\n\nCompose her song and then conduct the mighty Mandachord, turning bass, beat and melody into an anthem of devastation.\nGet Octavia today by purchasing her in the Market for Platinum, or by completing Octavia’s Anthem to get her Blueprint. Her parts can be found in the following ways:\n\nConduct your very own symphony, Tenno. Octavia’s abilities are powered by the Mandachord, a formidable tool used to mix Melody, Bass, and Percussion into a harmony of destruction. Compose a song before entering the battle by going to your Arsenal, selecting the Appearance tab, and hitting the “Mandachord” button.\nIn this guide, we will be using the Adau Instruments to get you started on composition since they are the default Mandachord Instruments. There are also 4 other Instruments available in the Market for Platinum if you own Octavia:\nAlpha Instruments\nBeta Instruments\nDruk Instruments\nGamma Instruments\nEach Instrument is in the same key (D minor Pentatonic), so if you’re feeling adventurous try mixing and matching Instruments to create unique compositions.\nThe Mandachord is comprised of 4 bars which are represented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 (seen in the background of each bar). Placing one note at the start of each bar is a whole note. Each bar is divided into quarters which are represented by the vertical lines. The tempo is set to 120 beats per minute, meaning each bar is 2 seconds long, and each slot is a 16th note.\nThe fastest way to start your composition is to tackle the Percussion track first! Using the Adau Instruments, place the outer drum sound on every quarter note, the second drum sound on the first note of the first bar, and the third drum sound in the third slot of every quarter:\nSpoiler\n\nSpoiler\nYou will notice the pitch rises as you move towards the outer ring of the Mandachord. Each Instrument works this way, enabling your notes to sound at the same pitch with different Instruments. Other Instruments have different bass-only sounds for this section as well, so feel free to experiment.\n\n\nSpoiler\nYou can also form chords by placing notes together on the same beat!\nSpoiler\nSpoiler\n\nSpoiler\n\nTry maintaining the same Percussion throughout your composition.\nStart off by playing the lowest notes for the Bass in the first bar, and then increasing their pitch in each subsequent bar. Do the same for the Melody section. The key to getting good results is to slightly change the notes that are playing from bar to bar.\nThere are composition note limits:\nThe Bass track has a 16 note limit per composition.\nThe Melody track has a 16 note limit per composition.\nThe Percussion track has a 26 note limit per composition.\nUse the “Volume Mixer” to adjust the volume for each track.\nUse “Track Isolation” to toggle each track on and off.\nUse “Reload” to revert any new changes back to the original selected/saved song.\nDon’t forget to save your compositions into a song slot. You can save a total of 5 songs!\nUse “Load Song” to select one of your custom songs or one of the default Instrument songs to load into the Mandachord.\n\nIn order to send and receive songs, you must own Octavia.\nTyping [Song] in chat will bring up a list of your saved songs to chose from. Hovering your cursor over a song will play it for easy selection:\nSpoiler\nOnce you have selected a song to share, a link with its title will appear in chat for others to save. Clicking on a song link will give you the following instructions on how to load the song into your own Mandachord:\nSpoiler\nOnce you have the song loaded into your Mandachord, you are free to edit it. You can also save shared songs, but keep in mind the 5 song slot limit.\n\nShow off your favorite Warframe and Fashion ‘Frame with the new Captura feature. Use a vast array of tools to compose the perfect shot. Choose from numerous available locations, spawn in enemies, slow down, or speed up time and compose a stunning photograph. Add more depth to your composition with dozens of filters, special effects and graphic options.\nHead to the Arsenal and select your Warframe Appearance tab. There you will see a new button titled Captura on the bottom right. Upon launching Captura, you can select from the following Captura Scenes:\nCORPUS SHIP MAINTENANCE SCENE\nGRINEER GALLEON CARGO SCENE\nINFESTED SHIP HOLOGRAM SCENE\nEach Syndicate also offers their own themed Captura Scene, available at a Standing price. Interested in applying your own background scene or having a solid color background to your Captura images? Visit Simaris in the Relay to purchase the Color Key Scene for Standing. Teshin also has Conclave Scenes to offer, visit him the in the Relay to add these to your Captura Scene selection.\nBe sure to share your Captura screenshots with the Community\nwe can’t wait to see how creative you get! https://forums.warframe.com/topic/776648-update-20-share-your-captura-screenshots/\n\n\nA high tempo rifle. Choose between automatic and semi automatic fire to lay waste to your enemies. Its primary fire rewards increased accuracy and fire rate with consistent shooting. Its alt fire will load up 10 ammo before being shot in a single blow. The Tenora can be purchased in the Market for Platinum or researched in the Tenno Lab Dojo room.\nThis fan hammer pistol, like the Tenora, also has two firing modes. Its semi-automatic primary fire will please sharpshooters. Its alt fire packs a punch (several) by emptying its entire clip in one trigger pull, but hold steady, the shots also have some kick to them. The Pandero can be purchased in the Market for Platinum or you can purchase its Blueprint in the Market for crafting.\n\nAn alternate helmet for Wukong.\nAn alternate helmet for Octavia.\nAccentuate the Kavat’s sleek profile with this enchanting decorative armor!\nWho is this gangly creature on your Landing Craft?! Who let this malformed Infested inside?! KILL IT WITH FIR\noh wait, that’s the newly reskinned Helminth Charger! With a whole new look comes a new attitude.\nFor those of you looking for the original Charger model, you can find the Helminth Degenerate Pattern as a Cosmetic Option in the Market available for Credits!\nJavlok, Buzlok, Ferrox, Harpak, Hind, Mutalist Quanta, Penthera, Paracyst, Penta, Quanta (Vandal), Stradavar, Tenora, Zarr\nAzima, Euphona Prime, Kulstar, Pandero, Talons\n5 new emotes are available for your hip-shaking convenience!\nGlissade Narta\nMaestro Narta\nPoise Narta\nTempo Narta\nPendulum Narta\nThe Relays and Maroo’s Bazaar now offer dedicated music zones, where you can share your Mandachord compositions and boogie down with fellow Tenno. Simply bring Octavia to one of the areas marked with the symbol seen in the image below, and select any of the Narta emotes listed above to start the party.\n\nDojos have a “free for all” policy when it comes to sharing your Mandachord compositions. Team up with your Clan to create symphonies in the comfort of your own Dojo, without concern of getting a noise complaint.\nDojo sessions are now hosted using the Relay system!\nThis means that Dojo sessions will be no longer be handled with the Host and Client method, eliminating potential host migrations or other host-related connectivity issues. Clan members will be able to invite other Tenno to the Dojo and leave without forcing their invitees out as well.\nFor performance’s sake, the Instance limit for Relays also applies to this new system. You and 49 other Tenno will be able to visit the Dojo at the same time before another Instance is created, and any modifications done to the Dojo will still propagate across each Instance simultaneously.\nAs a result of these changes, “Host” will be removed from the Clan Roles list since any and all Clan members will now be able to access the Dojo at all times.\nTrading in the Dojo now works similarly to trading in the Maroo's Bazaar where players can \"set up shop\". The trading post still shows all players in the Dojo with trades remaining for the day, but Players can now start a trade from the Trading Post or by interacting with another Player who is in trading mode.\nDuelling will use the original Dojo hosting system, where it will create one session for the duelling Tenno. Players will be able to trade in the Duelling Room, but not during a Duelling Session.\nA new and improved Mastery Rank-Up screen is here! When you become eligible for a rank-up, a new option to initiate your test will appear at the top of the pause menu (instead of directly under your name). Upon selecting to start your test, a new screen appears that shows you what Mastery Rank test you’re about to attempt, what rewards you will receive upon a successful completion, and helpful hints!\nSee it in action: https://twitter.com/PabloPoon/status/839946792078831616\nIn addition to the Dojo hosting changes, Clan Affinity will be awarded depending on the amount of effort expended towards bettering one’s Clan. This Clan Affinity will contribute to the Clan’s Rank and is awarded as follows:\nThe first time you construct an Oracle Room, Bio Lab, Chem Lab, Energy Lab, Tenno Lab, Orokin Lab, Duelling Room and Obstacle Course.\nThe first time you construct a Trading Post, Treasury, and Temple of Honor.\nUpon completion of Clan Research.\nThe amount of Clan Affinity earned by building Rooms or Decorations are listed in their respective selection screens; Research entries have been given the same treatment within the Lab UI. A Research tab has also been added to the Clan Profile, which will list all research and its state of completion per Lab!\nDon’t worry if your Clan has already done all or part of the above tasks \nthe rewards are retroactive! The appropriate amount of Clan Affinity has been given to all existing Clans with this Update.\nAll existing Clans are currently at the initial Rank, regardless of their Clan Affinity. Once its members complete the Ascension Ceremony, the Clan will Ascend to the highest Clan Rank attainable with their current amount of Affinity.\nWhat is this Ascension Ceremony? If you have earned enough to reach the next Rank, a new Decoration called the Ascension Altar will become active! To participate in this Ceremony, a clan member simply needs to interact with this device. Depending on your Clan Tier, a certain number of members must partake in this ceremony in order to reach Ascension, but under no time limit.\nParticipants will immediately be awarded Endo upon interacting with the Altar, and any remaining Clan members will be able to interact with the Altar and receive an Endo reward within 72 hours after the Ascension Ceremony has been completed. Participants from Clans who have enough Clan Affinity to Ascend multiple Ranks will be rewarded with Endo from each individual Rank.\nThe required number of participants per Tier are as follows:\nGhost: 1\nShadow: 5\nStorm: 15\nMountain: 30\nMoon: 50\nThe amount of Endo awarded per Clan Rank is as follows:\nRank One: 1,000\nRank Two: 2,000\nRank Three: 3,000\nRank Four: 4,000\nRank Five: 5,000\nRank Six: 6,000\nRank Seven: 7,000\nRank Eight: 8,000\nRank Nine: 9,000\nFor Clans who have earned the current max Clan Affinity at the time of this update, completing the Ascension Ceremony will award each participant (and any other player who interacts with the Altar within 72 hours after its completion) with a grand total of 45,000!\nTo remove any confusion between these new Clan Ranks and the existing ones, Clan Hierarchy is now used to describe a player’s position within the Clan, whether they are a Warlord or an Initiate.\nAll of these changes are the foundation for a larger system planned for release later this year, so stay tuned, Tenno!\nSniper Crewman now are able to deploy mini-robots known as Ratel. These fast-moving mini robotics units are quick and can quickly overwhelm even the strongest Tenno \ntake them out at the source!\nWe have increased the spawn chance of Sniper Crewman in Corpus missions. We have also reduced the spawn chance of Sapping Ospreys (which will mean less Sapper Mines) and lowered the maximum allowable simultaneous instances of Sapping Ospreys.\nBow and Sniper lovers rejoice! A new strategy for annihilating Nullifiers is now available. Nullifier backpacks are now equipped with Projector Drones that are deployed overhead. These Projector Drones are the power source behind the Nullifiers’ bubbles, and determine the growth, size, and vitality of the bubble. Here is what you can expect from the Nullifiers’ updated backpacks:\nWhen alerted for the first time, Nullifiers will deploy their Projector Drone to create a bubble.\nWhen in contact with varying ceiling heights, the Projector Drone will adjust its own height and reduce the size of the bubble to remain targetable.\nIf the bubble has been popped, the Projector Drone will return to the backpack for a brief period of time before being deployed again.\nIf the Projector Drone is destroyed, the bubble will pop and render the Nullifier permanently unable to make bubbles.\nProjector Drone health scales with enemy level.\nFixed Nullifiers so that stealth finisher targets don’t grow the bubble, as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/765409-bug-with-nullifiers-and-stealth-kills\nThe World State Window now has progressive disclosure and will only display the missions and Categories for content in which a player has met the criteria. Some of this is partially in place, but this is a more exhaustive change that ensures new players are not overwhelmed by seeing content they cannot play.\nAlerts will only appear in the World State Window if you have the planet unlocked.\nInvasions will only show if you have the planet unlocked.\nSorties will only become visible after completing The War WIthin.\nSyndicate Daily Missions only appear if a player is a member of a Syndicate.\nVoid Fissures will not appear until a player obtains their first Relic\nLimbo is a Warframe with one of the most complicated skillsets. When his skills are mastered, he becomes an unstoppable force of Rift manipulation. While many have perfected the Limbo, there's been a general sense he needs to be revisited to make the mastering feel more rewarding.\nWith this Update, we have revisited Limbo.  Changes to Limbo include the following:\nWhile in the Rift, Limbo receives a slight Energy regeneration. Additionally, enemies killed in the Rift will grant Limbo 10 Energy.\nLimbo darts in and out of different Planes of existence at no Energy cost. Tapping the roll key (default binding Shift) will shift Limbo between the Rift and Material Plane. Shifting into the Rift leaves behind a tear that, for a brief period of time (5s), Limbo and Allies can use it to enter the Rift. Limbos that enter the Rift through the tear can remain in the Rift as long as they please, unlike Allies who have temporary access.\nSend enemies and Allies within a small radius into or out of the Rift for a period of time. Banish targets must be in the same Plane as Limbo to be affected. For example, Limbo must be in the Material Plane to Banish Material Plane targets to the Rift and vice versa. Banished enemies will take damage when casted and will be knocked down for a brief period of time.\nStop Banished enemies in their tracks by putting them in Stasis for a period time. Toggle the ability on and move within the Rift to strategically set up shots around enemies affected by Stasis. Projectiles will stay suspended until the Stasis timer runs out, until toggled off, or until the 300 projectile limit has been reached, upon which your torrent of projectiles will be launched at the enemy.\nVoid energy surges through Limbo and into the Rift, charging enemies within it. Charged enemies that cross over to the Material Plane will Banish themselves and nearby enemies back into the Rift. When charged enemies die outside of the Rift, they surge and transfer the charge to nearby enemies.\nBridging the Rift and Material Planes, Cataclysm creates a sphere of Void Energy that shifts enemies within its radius into the Rift. During its creation and final collapse, enemies stumble and take damage. The sphere’s final collapse deals damage to enemies both in and out of the sphere, and scales based on the health and shields of ALL enemies in the Rift.\nMission objective items, such as Datamass, can now be carried in and out of the Rift Plane. However! Be careful not to drop these items in the Rift Plane, as they can only be picked up in the Material Plane.\nAllies in Cataclysm's sphere can now collect pickups including mission objective items.\nThe Rift Torrent Augment Mod will now grant Limbo a damage increase (15/20/25/30%) for every enemy affected by Rift Surge and has had it’s description changed to reflect this.\nToned down the FX while in the Rift.\nAs we near the staggering number of 300 weapons (including variants), the task of balancing grows increasingly daunting. At its core, Warframe is a co-operative game; having powerful tools is a boon to a team rather than a disadvantage. However, there are a few weapons that have such a dominating effect in missions that co-operative missions essentially become solo. Aside from the handful of dominating weapons, there are even more that have been overlooked.\nThe Miter is one of the oldest examples of killer concept with lackluster results. The next Update will bring the following:\nIncreased chance of dismemberment on kills.\nIncreased speed of Projectiles.\nCharge time has been halved.\nCritical Chance of 5% for a quick shot.\nCritical Chance of 10% for a charged shot.\nHit detection is now based on the size of the Sawblade.\nMastery Rank increased to 6.\nThe Harpak's stats aren't the worst in the scheme of Primaries, but it has received some love since it is often overlooked.\nRecoil has been reduced on the Primary Fire.\nThe Alt-Fire Charge time has been removed \nit is now an instant harpoon.\nThe Critical Chance has been increased to 20%.\nIncreased the range of the Alt-Fire from 15 meters to 40 meters.\nIncreased the flight speed of the Alt-Fire and updated the FX.\nAdjusted pull strength of the Harpak’s alt fire to have enemies more likely to end up near you.\nThe Hind has more nicknames than most Primaries (Baguette, etc), but not as much use.\nWe've added a single-shot Semi-Auto Alt Fire to the Hind that has increased Damage, Critical, and Status Chance.\nLike the Miter, the Panthera is a killer idea with lackluster execution. We've made the following changes:\nPrimary Fire has been switched to Automatic, and the fire rate has been increased.\nThe Status Chance of Primary Fire has been increased to 20%\nCritical Hit Chance of Primary Fire is now 10%\nThe Critical Multiplier is now 2x.\nAmmo Requirement is reduced to 2.\nSecondary Fire Status chance is now 35%\nCritical hit Chance of Secondary is now 25%\nHit detection is now based on the size of the projectile.\nMastery Rank is now 7.\nThe Paracyst is one of the more spine-tingling weapons in the Arsenal that really runs with the Infested theme.\nThe damage of the Primary Fire has been increased by 5.\nUpdated the FX of the projectiles of the Primary Fire.\nIncreased the range of the Alt-Fire tether to 50 m.\nThe Status Chance of the Primary and Secondary Fire has been increased to 30%\nThe Critical Chance of Primary Fire has been increased to 10%\nMastery Rank is now 5.\nThe Mutalist Quanta is getting more of a mechanic change rather than just stats.\nIt will have its Alt-Fire stack similar to the Simulor to make a large Infested Orb that you can shoot through for additional stats.\nThe Buzlok and its homing mechanism has been used for many creative moments \nbut ultimately this weapon has been overlooked.\nThe Ammo Requirement for the Secondary Homing has been reduced to 2.\nPhysical Damage distribution has been adjusted to 50% Impact, 40% Puncture, and 10% Slash.\nDamage has been increased to 60 from 45.\nCritical Chance increased to 15%\nCritical Damage increased to 2.5x\nThe flight speed of the Homing Beacon has been increased.\nThe Homing Beacon will now only stick to NPC & Characters.\nCritical Chance increased by 50% on targets with Homing Beacon attached to them.\nClip size reduced to 50.\nMastery Rank increased to 9.\nThe Ice Beam weapon: the Glaxion. Probably one of the most exciting weapons to imagine in combat, yet it has received a cold reception.\nCold Damage has increased to 333 from 250.\nThe rate at which ammo is consumed has been decreased.\nIncreased the Accuracy of the Glaxion.\nReduced the range from 30 meters to 24 meters.\nThe Ogris has gone through a visual Upgrade, and now it's time for a stat upgrade. To many, this was their first entry into Launcher weapons \nare you willing to give it another look?\nThe Flight Speed of the projectile has been increased.\nThe Status Chance has been increased to 35%.\nThe charge time to fire the Ogirs has been reduced.\nThe direct Impact damage of the projectile has been decreased to 100.\nAoE damage has increased to 600.\nAoE range has increased to 6 meters.\nMastery Rank requirement has increased to 8.\nThe Attica was the debut entry into Automatic Primary Crossbows! We've revisited it to perhaps bring it back into the spotlight of your Arsenal.\nThe Weapon Recoil has been reduced.\nThe Fire Rate has been increased.\nThe Flight Speed of the bolts has increased.\nThe Critical Chance has increased to 25%.\nThe Critical Multiplier has increased to 2x.\nThe Ammo Capacity has increased to 20.\nWe have nerfed 3 weapons (plus 1 variant)  that we feel disrupts the co-op setting and pace of gameplay for most groups:\nThe Tonkor's rocket jumping mechanic has long been obsolete since the introduction of bullet jumping, so the Tonkor now deals self-damage like all other launchers.\nThe Tonkor Grenade trajectory line now appears on holding the fire button (Default Left Mouse), and grenade fires on release.\nThe grenade needs to travel 6m before arming itself, it will bounce off yourself, other players and AI before then.\nThe Maximum lifespan of grenade has dropped from 5 to 3 seconds \ngrenades are quicker to explode\nGrenades bounce lower and explode sooner, making them more likely to explode where they are shot.\nThe Critical Chance has been reduced to 25%.\nThe Accuracy of the Tonkor has been increased.\nThe Simulor's entry into Arsenals marked one of the more unique moments in Weapon history. It's always been a little weird \nstacking orbs together leads to both passive and active death. The stacking itself causes damage and the fully stacked orb can be activated with your 'Alt Fire' button for an additional explosion.\nThe Status Chance has been increased to 30%.\nThe amount of Orbs required to make a full stack has decreased \nit used to take 5, now it takes 3.\nA Critical Chance of 2% has been added.\nThe AoE Explosion range (based on stack when expires or manual detonation) increased from 0.5-2.8 meters to 1-6 meters.\nThe Explosion Damage has increased from 50 per orb to 75 (225 at full stack).\nOn an orb stacking event (when orbs combine), damage range decreased to 1-6 from 3-8\nOn an orb stacking event, damage decreased from 150-250 to 20-40\nThe Simulor has had its max Ammo Capacity reduced to 60.\nConsidering the Simulor was the only Primary Cephalon weapon, it was easy to see a Synoid version entering Arsenals. Like its vanilla counterpart, it's always been a little weird \nstacking orbs together leads to both passive and active death. The stacking itself causes damage and the fully stacked orb can be activated with your 'Alt Fire' button for an additional explosion.\nThe Status Chance increased to 35%\nThe amount of Orbs required to make a full stack has decreased \nit used to take 5, now it takes 4.\nA Critical Chance of 5% has been added.\nThe AoE Explosion range (based on stack when expires or manual detonation) increased from 0.5-2.8 meters to 1-8 meters.\nThe Explosion Damage has increased from 50 per orb to 75 (300 at full stack).\nOn an orb stacking event (when orbs combine), damage range decreased to 1-8 from 3-8\nOn an orb stacking event, damage decreased from 150-250 to 20-50\nThe Synoid Simulor has had its max Ammo Capacity reduced to 75.\nThe only melee entry on the list is the Telos Boltace.\nThis weapon is receiving a bit more of a mechanic change rather than a purely numerical change.\nThe Slide attack will create a vortex that staggers and draws enemies toward you.\nThe following Slide attack (after a vortex) will radial blast and ragdoll enemies away from you.\nThis 'back and forth' will be on a cooldown.\nIf you have invested into a nerfed weapon, when the Update releases there will be an Inbox message generated on Login to give you a single 3 day Affinity Booster and a Forma per owned weapon to reconfigure your weapons as you see fit!\nRegarding any Rivens you may have or are looking to pick up for any of the listed weapons: you can expect small changes to stats. Stay tuned for more information in the Update notes!\nFixed the Tether Grenade Mod for the Penta cancelling Self Damage.\nThere is now a toggle option for how you want to fly: old vs. new! This option allows players to switch between the original Archwing flight system that we introduced vs the newer one we added. You can find this in the Options menu by going to Controls > Archwing > Toggle Experimental Flight!\nRemoved unusable Ammo Drops from Archwing.\nImproved the radius and 'suck speed' of Archwing's innate vacuum.\nThe Vulkar Wraith is now tradable!\nEmotes no longer remain active while changing your Arsenal in the Relay.\nFocus Convergence Orbs will now spawn closer to you \nbefore they would spawn within 40 to 80 meters, now they will spawn within 30 to 60 meters.\nThe Judgement points required to enter the various Rathuum missions and to fight Kela de Thaym on Merrow have been reduced! The Judgement points earned remains the same.\nYam now requires 10 judgement points.\nVodyanoi now requires 15 judgement points\nMerrow now requires 25 judgement points.\nAll of the Index mission options available on The Index node on Neptune have been removed, except for the Endurance mode. This node is optional, and is not required to complete Neptune. Since Endurance modes play out with no explicit end, we've made all Index enemies drop all Index exclusive modes so that you can remain in the same Endurance mission without missing out on drops that the enemies don't spawn.\nDecreased the hit box on the Grineer Rollers to better match the visual mesh.\nReduced particles from the Telos Boltace slide attack as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/764794-balance-the-telos-boltace/?page=2#comment-8431700\nRe-arranged Stims to appear together in Dojo Research.\nAdded mini-map marker for Dojo Transporter.\nRemoved bounding boxes of Dojo and Orbiter Decorations, except around Triggerable or Interactive sections of Decorations. This means you will have a much, much easier time placing Decorations! In a way, the sky is the limit.\nOverlapping Waypoint markers are now sorted by distance from player.\nBleedout Markers now hover above the player’s head and will follow them if they crawl around.

  "additions": "\n\nAs stated and shown on Devstream #85, the Helminth Cure is here. By now, a majority of Tenno have been faced with a persistent and protruding infection on numerous Warframes. For those with a fully 7-day matured Helminth Cyst, the individual permanent cure awaits you in the Helminth Infirmary. The completion of Glast Gambit is not required to have your Helminth Cyst removed, and once the cure has been administered that Warframe will not be granted access back into the room and can no longer be infected. Keep in mind that breeding a Helminth Charger requires a mature Helminth Cyst to be drained\nthe choice is yours!\nWithout spoiling too much, we have a script incoming that fixes and applies the proper Alignment choices made in The Glast Gambit between the window of Dec 22 9am ET and Dec 23 10am ET. Further investigation from reports showed that ‘Moon’ choices gave a ‘Neutral’ outcome and vice versa during this window (was later fixed).\nWe will update this post when the script has finished!\nScript is complete! Alignment has been corrected for those in the affected time window.\nNidus, Ash Koga Profile and Frost Harka Icons have been added to the Market for purchase!\nAdded controller shake to Titania’s Razorwing ability.\n",
  "changes": "The Glast Gambit: Update 19.6.0:\nIncreased the base health of Nidus’ Maggots to 1k.\nIncreased Nidus’ Mutation Stack consumption from 10 to 15 when knocked into a bleedout state/death. The task of regaining 10 Stacks is quickly obtainable, making this consequence for dying too light. Although 15 Stacks is not a huge jump, we’re hoping it’s closer to that sweet spot! \nEntering a Nullifier bubble will now drain down Mutation Stacks the longer you are in the bubble. \nTo increase the visibility of Nidus' Maggots, holding down Nidus’ Virulence will now display a HUD marker on them. Keep in mind that casting Virulence on Maggots cause them to detonate!\nNidus’ Ravenous Maggots no longer auto detonate when feasting on enemies. Previously the Maggots could do a majority of the grunt work and you were able to watch the carnage and gain Stacks at the same time. Now to pop the Maggots you’ll need to cast Virulence on them and rejoice in your hard earned Stack accumulation. It’s also worth noting that with testing by our team, the Stack rhythm before and after this change wasn’t noticed at all. \nImproved the FX of Maggot explosion to better represent the intended area of explosion.\nNidus’ Ravenous Maggots will still attack but no longer latch on other Infested Maggots or Kuva Jesters due to awkward animations.  \nFixed FX, Maggots, & Health regeneration while in Ravenous staying around forever if cast by a Client who leaves.\nUpdated and improved the look of Frost’s abilities with fancy new ice textures! \nFurther optimized network access to help alleviate ‘Network Not Responding’ issues.\nPlayers who have reached the Riven Mod capacity can now continue to trade Riven Mods as long as the trade does not result in going over the capacity.\nIn an effort to address the issue of people not noticing the movement of The Kuva Fortress, we have made the loop completion time odd rather than a 24 hour cycle. Players who were logging in around the same daily time found that the Kuva Fortress would always be roughly in the same position, and was restricting the variety of Kuva Siphon missions available.\nWhen not connected to Steam and viewing a TennoGen item, the price will now read ‘Workshop Item’ instead of ‘$0.00’. \nChanged ‘Tenno’ to ‘allies’ in the Cat’s Eye Mod description. \nTweaked Nova Asuri Collection description to clarify that the arm/hands FX is not part of the Danavi Syandana, but on cast of Nova’s powers. \nRemoved ability to see Codex information about Relics you do not own. \nRemoved ability to purchase multiple Arcane Distillers from Syndicates since they are now no longer consumed on use.\nVulkar and Vulkar Wraith are now usable in Conclave!\nImpair on hit status removed from Opticor in Conclave.\nTeshin’s Conclave Affinity Inbox message will no longer open automatically. This was resulting in Conclave Affinity being claimed and lost if you were maxed out.\nFixed a tileset hole in the Celestial Ruins Conclave tileset.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed a loss of functionality when attempting to purchase more Riven slots after exiting out of the Mod station and having the Riven menu pop up.\nFixed Health Conversion and Energy Conversion Mod FX not appearing on Clients.\nFixed (for real) Clients not being able to complete the \"Find and defeat Lephantis in Orokin Derelict\" Eris Junction task.\nFixed performance issues in The Index.\nFixed a script error when your Companion used Regeneration.\nFixed a couple script errors when using Focus abilities.\nFixed a script error that can occur when clicking linked Chat items.\nFixed a script error when casting Equinox’s Metamorphosis ability.\nFixed a script error when casting Frost’s Ice Wave ability. \nFixed a script error that prevented Zenurik Magnetic Aftershock from working.\nFixed a script crash if you go near the Operator on your Landing Craft with the Helminth Cyst.\nFixed an issue where if you owned ~18+ Rivens, none of your placed Decorations in your Landing Craft would load when first returning from a mission/logging in.\nFixed Clients not being able to trigger the Kuva Siphon.\nFixed Host Migrations breaking Kuva Siphon gameplay.\nFixed the Atterax floating away from your Warframe at the start of a mission.\nFixed items sometimes being teleported out of Defense levels.\nFixed being able to use weapons with Alternate Fire while in Wukong’s Cloudwalker.\nFixed doors on the Landing Craft pushing you out of the world. \nFixed an issue where if you received a Booster as a Sortie reward, the World State Window would show all Sortie rewards as being owned.\nFixed Client and Host seeing the Javlok in different positions once thrown.\nFixed arrows and bolt projectiles not getting embed in geometry as before.\nFixed some TennoGen items having a UI bug which resulted in them appearing as giftable even though no gifting could actually take place. \nFixed numerous broken dialogue transmission animations.\nFixed the Helminth Hunt precept Mod having redundant description text.\nFixed not zooming into Quest nodes when selected and initiated from the World State Window. \nFixed the Kuva Fortress position not setting up correctly every other day.\nFixed a UI issue related to Temporal Anti-Aliasing. \nFixed the Mesa Longhorn helmet missing it’s dangly additions as per:\nFixed enemies being able to attack you during boss cinematic animations. \nFixed Ordis stating that Captain Vor is on Mercury when he is actually on Earth in Vor’s Prize.\nFixed enemies not spawning in high level Corpus Mobile Defense Invasion missions.\nFixed a door appearing to have duplicate textures.\n\nFixed the Frost Harka Helmet being in inventories without having purchased it.\n",

Overwhelm your enemies with swarms of butterflies, mesmerize and distract foes with shiny lures and morph into a deadly, flying fairy.\nA Glyph Prism awaits you in your Gear wheel!\nAccess your Glyphs in the new ‘GLYPHS’ category under PROFILE in the menu, and select which Glyph you would like to use! GLYPH is now the catch-all word for Profile Pictures, so you'll see your Glyph selection determine that and your Forum Profile!\nIf you're asking yourself 'Where are my Fusion Cores and what is Endo?\", please read this section carefully! This section explains the conversion from a Fusion Core / Duplicate Mod fusion system to the Endo Fusion system.\nFusion in Warframe is one of the main systems that encourages investment in your Mod collection and Upgrading your gear. With calculated clicking and collecting, you can take your unranked Mods to top tier performers.\nWith the change to an Endo system we've removed the hidden complexity of Fusion. This Endo Fusion system maintains many aspects of the hold.\nWhat is Endo? Endo is Fusion energy incarnate. It is the raw resource that powers the process of Upgrading Mods. In essence, Endo serves as the simplifier in all things Fusion. All duplicate Mods can now be simply converted into Endo. Endo will now drop from enemies and missions where Fusion Cores used to be.\nFusing with Endo makes the Mod Rank increases clear, as the system now only increases in whole Ranks. Partial upgrading with unclear requirements towards your next rank will no longer exist, and neither will wasted Fusion energy. The UI will tell you exactly how much Endo is needed for the next Rank, which gives you a clear goal to work toward.\nAny partial Mod upgrades before this Update will be refunded with equivalent Endo and Credits.\nTreasures: discoverable ancient valuables that can be constructed and converted into high Endo quantities. \nTrading of Endo (in the form of Treasures).\nAdded Rarity colour grading to the Relic Reward selection screen in Fissure missions. \nSoft launch of colourblind door symbols! These new symbols should help you determine if a door is locked or unlocked, as they no longer rely on the sole use of colour. \nAdded a warning message when the last member of an Alliance’s creator Clan tries to dissolve the Clan. \nAdded indicators in the Arsenal of how many Forma are installed in gear, and whether or not gear has been fully Mastered! \nAdded a waypoint marker for Cephalon Fragments. \nAdded more Relic Rewards into Rotation A in replacement of some Credit Bundles and Mods.\n",
  "changes": "The Silver Grove:\nLunaro has been out in the wild for a couple of weeks now, and in this time we've been play testing extensively \ninternally and externally \nand have been listening to your feedback. In an effort to address your concerns and increase the overall playability of the mode we've implemented a number of new gameplay features, arenas, customizations, and back end systems. Read on below for further details:\nNew Conclave weapon skins for the following weapons can now be purchased for standing from Tehsin once you’ve acquired the Typhoon rank:\nHaven't played any Lunaro since launch? Feeling a bit rusty? Well worry no more! The introduction of the new Lunaro Warm-Up system will take players currently waiting in a not full lobby and load them all into a practice session. These sessions will see all active players equipped with their own Lunaro so as to allow everyone the chance to practise basic game mechanics while waiting for additional loadings to join. Once a game is full and ready to begin the match will naturally progress to the proper Lunaro mode with goals, assists, and saves from the previous Warm-Up being wiped clear.\nMuch of the feedback we've received from our seasoned PvP players and newcomers alike was our inscrutable matchmaking rules. We've attempted to stream lines and have separated the rules used to match players in PvE from those used for PvP. Specifics on these PvP specific matchmaking rules are as follows:\nWhen attempting to join a friend you will be placed on their team if there is available space.\nIf you create a squad and then create/join a PvP lobby you will all be placed on the same team. Subsequent joiners will fill the opposing team slots.\nInviting a Friend who is currently in a squad will attempt to being in the full squad into your current game/lobby.\nAttempting to join a PvP match without enough space for you and your squad will now present an error message indicating that there isn't space to accommodate everyone.\nA similar error message to the above will be displayed when a full Squad of 4 players attempts to join a Lunaro match.\nInvite and Friends Only Lobbies now have a \"Switch Team\" option.\nAnother common gripe that has sometimes been affecting our competitive PvP modes was one that affects almost all games of this nature; rage quitters. While any system we introduce won't be able to completely solve this issue we've enacted a consequence system that will hopefully curb some of the more numerous instances:\nWe now track players who quit out of matches including those using the Alt-F4 method.\nThe Penalty system has 2 stages; a warning and a penalty applied state:\nThe warning stage will appear on the Landing Craft after the game detects that you've quit out of a match prematurely.\nThe Penalty Applied state will kick in after a certain % of your last games are determined to have been prematurely left. This state results in an XP Penalty of 75%.\nPlayer's can climb back out of the Penalty Applied state by completing a corresponding amount of full matches.\nWhile also negatively affecting rage quitters, we want to encourage those who continue to play while short on players and those who play multiple matches in a row.\nCompleting a match you were short on will result in a +20% boost to XP and Standing.\nCompleting subsequent matches will results in 10% more XP and Standing after the first match.\nWith the launch of Lunaro on Consoles we introduced full customization options for Lunaro controls. With this update we will be introducing the same functionality for PC keyboard and mouse users.\nHead over to the Options screen to configure your Lunaro bindings as you see fit!\nAnother major complaint directed toward our Conclave game modes has been the potential for laggy experiences due to the game running on our peer to peer system. With this update we will be rolling out the first stages of a potential solution to this issue: volunteer player hosted servers \nwe've got the tools in place to allow you to host Lunaro.\nAt this stage volunteer servers are limited to running Lunaro only, and require a separate dedicated computer to host.\nThe initial roll-out will be conducted via an invite-only process due to the need to gauge scalability and success. We will be using this soft launch to gather valuable feedback and stats and once we determine that the system is ready to provide the best experience we will be moving forward with a full scale public

  "changes": "Specters Of The Rail: U2.1:\nDesecrate is now a toggle ability! Energy (or Health if you use the Despoil Augment) are consumed on Desecration. \nCorpses that enter the Desecrate radius will be eligible for desecration. The first corpse 'heats up' slowly for a couple seconds and then the rest occur in rapid succession (like popcorn).\nEach enemy desecrated will now cost 10 Energy (or Health if the Despoil Augment is equipped). This is affected by Efficiency Mods. \nHealth orbs are no longer guaranteed drops from Desecrated corpses. They are now tied in with the chance for additional loot drops.\nThe number of Shadows spawned has been reduced to 7 and is no longer affected by Mods. This is a necessary change for performance on all platforms. To compensate for this, Nekros now spawns stronger Shadows prioritized by heavy unites killed with Shield multiplier and draw aggro more heavily. \nShadows now live until they die with Health decay over time that is affected by Duration instead of Strength. \nShadows of the Dead can be recast while active to spawn new Shadows to replace dead ones, and refill the Health/Shields of the current Shadows. \n*Recasting Shadows of the Dead will also teleport your Shadows to you within limits. (if they are >10m and <40m away)\nThe Shield of Shadows Augment has been reviewed to maintain efficacy with these changes.\n\nVaulted Relics will now appear in the Codex (ie: Relics that are not currently in circulation that you may own).\nThe Codex section for Relics and Arcanes will now show items you've discovered but don't own (like Mods do so you can see the drop sources to farm some more).\nTweaked the TennoGen Mesa Falcon Helmet tint.\nUpdated the TennoGen Rota Syandana materials.\nIncreased the brightness of the Guides of The Lotus Sigil.\nUpdated the Burston mesh in the Stalker diorama.\n",

  "additions": "Your Arsenal will now display the corresponding skin icon when equipped rather than the underlying Warframe.\nCompletely revisited old tilesets and added new rare loot spawn points for Syndicate Medallions and more.

We've gone over every player ability and augment to provide predictable interactions with Nullifier bubbles and ability immune enemies. Below are the rules that we have adhered by to offer a consistent avenue for players to strategize against foes in-battle.\nAbilities will not affect players or enemies within a Nullifier bubble.\nEffects of an ability on both players and enemies will be removed when entering Nullifier bubbles.\nA Warframe’s active abilities will be deactivated upon entering a Nullifier bubble.\nProjectiles spawned by an ability will be deflected when they encounter a Nullifier bubble. For example, Ember’s Fireball and Ash’s Shuriken will be deflected.\nAbilities that exist independent of their creator will not be deactivated if the Warframe enters a nullifier, but will be destroyed if touched by the bubble itself. For example, Frost’s Snowglobe will not disappear when Frost enters the bubble, but will be destroyed if the bubble comes into contact with the Snowglobe sphere.\nAdjusted the enemy counts for each mission; in most cases the spawn counts were increased.\nImproved enemy tactics to better plan assaults on player-controlled towers; by staging units ahead of time they can be more effective and draw the action to different points around the map.\nChanged how the different types of enemy unit are sent into the fray. Historically you'd see higher-tier units mid-way through the first round and there would be no escalation after that; you should now see more infantry in the first round and then more support and heavy units if you chose to stay to intercept more transmissions.\nTuned the enemy tables to fix the cases where certain levels were 50% enemies that couldn't capture points (eg: Drones).\nCorrupted Vor in T4 Interception will no longer delay the end of round countdown (just the end of round) so that if he's the last enemy you aren't stuck waiting as long.\nFixed the problem where low-level Interception missions were flooded with Eximus’.\nAdded an Interception Mission to Sedna, Berehynia.\nReveal hidden contents\nToxic Ancient's and Ancient Disrupter Auras will no longer stack with multiple Ancients of the same type.\nOberon’s Reckoning has a chance to make enemies drop health orbs which, when grabbed by you, heal your companions which revive them.\nFire rate Pistol mods will now affect Mesa's Peacemaker.\nAdded a PBR pass on materials for a variety of older Grineer and Infested levels.\nMade improvements to the spawn logic for Convergence pickups in Survival and Excavation missions.\nPhobos Tileset is now on Mars, and all Phobos missions are now on Asteroid Tileset.\nIncreased Dark Split-Swords Critical Chance while dual wielding by to 25% and Critical Multiplier to 2.5x.\nSlightly increased the Dark Split Sword dual wield attack speed.\nSlightly decreased the Dark Split Sword Heavy Blade attack speed.\nIncreased the Dark Split Sword Heavy Blade  Element Damage to 90 and Status Chance to 25%\nIncreased the Twin Basolk Status Chance to 40% and increased Elemental damage to 65.\nSlightly Increased Twin Basolk attack speed.\nIncreased Twin Basolk Ground Slam damage by 4x , attack radius to 7.5m, and Status Chance to 65%.\nTwin Basolk Ground Slams can now ragdoll enemies.\nIncreased the amount of Impact damage done with Stradavar automatic fire while decreasing the Puncture and Slash damage these attacks do.\nIncreased the amount of Puncture damage done with Stradavar semi-automatic fire while decreasing the amount of Slash damage these attacks do.\nSlightly decreased the amount of damage done by Stradavar automatic fire and increased the amount of damage done by semi-automatic attacks.\nIncreased the Stradavar Status Chance to 15%.\nPolished the hit detection of melee weapons within Nullifier bubbles. Some weapons, like the Tonbo for example, would strike the Nullifier bubble first, followed by the Nullifier agent in the same strike. However, the damage would only result on the bubble! The weapons can now strike both the bubble and the agent on the same strike, and the agent will take damage as long you are inside the bubble for the attack.\nRemoved in-mission challenges for all Mastery rank tests.\nRemoved two small sections on Nyx Prime that were un-tintable.\nAdjusted the Market icon size of the Akstilleto and Ballistica.\nChanged the way lighting works on Sigils in an attempt tone down excessive bloom.\nSortie Missions can now have more environmental wrinkles, traps, and obstacles within. Stay Alert!\nMade improvements to the animation look and feel of thrown weapons while holding a Datamass.\nAs a result of wanting to reduce the amount of playerbase splitting that the Syndicate Mission rank generation created, we've reduced this to simply have 7 missions per Syndicate.\nAt Rank 1 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 1, 2, 3.\nAt Rank 2 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 2, 3, 4.\nAt Rank 3 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 3, 4, 5.\nAt Rank 4 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 4, 5, 6.\nAt Rank 5 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 5, 6, 7.\nAs a result, now you are more likely play with other members of the Syndicate at close ranks to you. You will still now have 3 Syndicate missions active in your World state menu, but you should now have more people do them with!\nWarframe Helmet blueprints are now labeled as ‘Neuroptics’. Please note that when trading components, full Warframe sets now contain Systems, Chassis, and Neuroptics (previously Helmet) as components.\nPolished a variety of environment materials that were too bright.\nPolished a variety of old tileset decoration placements and layouts.\nPlayers can now choice to cancel an undesired squad migration if the migration is occurring while in a lobby.\nUpdated certain interactable Orokin Derelict consoles with new meshes.\nImproved your Sentinels responsiveness to catching up to you and staying at shoulder level when you're moving quickly.\nRescue targets can now shoot while following players. Teleport actions will still take precedent over this behavior when making your way to extraction.\nReduced the Syndicate buff FX to help aiming visibiltiy as per:\nIncreased the spawn rate of Rare Crates in The Jordas Verdict to match the Law of Retribution.\nThe Archwing ability stat screen will now show the correct range for abilities depending on context. (E.g. Blink used to show 100m, but in space you are 0.25x scale so distances are effectively 4x as far. So in space Blink will now show 400m. In water ranges are reduced, so Blink will show 39.69m.)\nGave Rescue hostages their own (incredibly generous) cover evaluators so their cover findings don't conflict with their behaviour. Gave them larger vision range so they react to dangers behind / next to them and not just when they get shot by them first.\nImproved finisher hit detection for multiple weapons. Reticles will now flash red when a finisher can be performed and with each hit for multistrike finisher moves.\nMultistrike finisher moves will have their damage split amongst each hit instead of now being delivered all at the end.\nPropaganda Drone damage reduction buffs no longer stack.\nImproved jump detection. Before players could prematurely double jump when just about to fall off a ledge, when falling off a small edge, or when walking down a steep incline. Regular jumps will now be performed in these scenarios.\nImproved Dojo and Liset decoration placement code.\nVauban’s Bastille now works on Corpus air units. (Attack Drones, etc.)\nIncreased the drop rate of Automatic Trigger.\nIncreased the drop rate of Vermillion Storm.\nImproved squad merging code to better facilitate Lunaro matchmaking.\nImproved migration code to better handle migrations occurring during PvP team selection phase.\nArchwing augment mods now display an <ARCHWING> tag to help differentiate them.\nImprove the physics on the Ki Teer Syandana.\n\n",
  "fixes": "\n\nSpecters of the Rail – changes to the Origin System are here, Tenno. What ghosts lurk the chambers of abandoned Junctions of a past era?\nFind a new way to experience the Origin System with the complete rework of the Star Chart.\n \nThis redesign of the original Star Chart will bring back the nostalgic roadmap design making it easier for you to travel the Origin System. The map is dynamic; zoom in and out and drag your way around the Origin System. Specific regions and missions will be easier to locate. Also, it will be clear to see which Missions you need to complete thanks to new Junctions -\nroutes between planets -\nguiding you on where to go next.\n \nWe've replaced and re-assigned many missions, including the removal of Deception and the not-so-popular Archwing Defense.\n \nDifficulty, planet progression, and enemy levels have been reassigned to better reflect the modern Solar System.\n \nDedicated memorials have been set up in Relays to display the names of contributing Founders!\n\nSpecters of the Rail live here \nyou must show you are worthy to conquer the Junction and ignite its Planetary travel power.\nJunctions link travel \nall players new and old must complete the Task list to activate the Junctions for progression and rewards.\nJunctions reward players with Mastery upon completion! Please note this Mastery reward is quite large, and offsets any Mastery points lost in the Star Chart changes of nodes per planet.\nVenus\nMercury Junction: Once Awake, Howl of the Kubrow\nEarth\nMars Junction: The Archwing\nMars\nPhobos Junction: Stolen Dreams\nJupiter\nEuropa Junction: The New Strange, Limbo Theorem Blueprint\nSaturn\nUranus Junction: Natah, Clem Quest\nUranus\nNeptune Junction: The Second Dream\nPluto\nSedna Junction: Hidden Messages Blueprint\nPluto\nEris Junction: Patient Zero Blueprint, The Jordas Precept Blueprint\n*Sands of Inaros Blueprint is still obtained from Baro Ki Teer.\n\nVoid Relic: Ancient Relics that react to Void Fissures to reveal treasures within.\nVoid Traces: Raw Void energy that drops in the process of uniting Relics and Fissures. Can be used to Refine Void Relics to yield more rare rewards in your Orbiter.\nReactant: Drops in missions and must be used in the Void Fissure sealing process.\nRefinement: The Process of improving the likelihood of Rare rewards from Void Relics.\nEra: An old Orokin age.\nLith / Meso / Neo / Axi: 4 Distinct Eras of the Orokin past, all suddenly manifesting through Void Fissures in the Solar Map.\nT1 Keys have turned into Lith Era Relics.\nT2 Keys have turned into Meso Era Relics.\nT3 Keys have turned into Neo Era Relics\nT4 Keys have turned into Axi Era Relics.\nVoid Relic Segment: Found on a Junction, used to Refine Void Relics.\nAfter years of new content releases and updated items to collect, there is a certain irony in calling the Void the “void”. Until Specters of the Rail, getting specific Prime parts was a repetitive and regimented process. Each Tower mission has a corresponding key and reward table, and if you want one of those rewards, you need to stock up on the appropriate key and repeat the same mission until you accomplish your goal. That all changes with the introduction of Relics. Instead of running the same mission repeatedly, Relics allow you to dynamically acquire the rewards you want by playing Fissure missions that appear on any planet, and there will always be Void Fissures active. Collecting cool rewards is a fundamental aspect of Warframe, and this new Void system is designed to make it more fun and immersive \nwith Void Fissures ripping into the very fabric of the Origin System!\n*Please note that Void Fissures will not be available for Assassinate and endless mission types \nexcluding Survival \nfor Launch. Further mission support will be coming shortly.\nRead the Developer Workshop here:\nSyndicate Void Key Pack has changed to Relic Pack.\nVoid Key Pack from the Market and Daily Tribute has changed to Relic Pack.\nAs for our good friend Baro, his sales/prices will be monitored closely to take new economy into account in terms of Ducat acquisition.\nAccess to the Derelicts is remaining the same.\nThe Refinement costs for improving an INTACT Void Relic are as follows:\nEXCEPTIONAL = 25 Void Traces\nFLAWLESS = 50 Void Traces\nRADIANT = 100 Void Traces\n\nReveal hidden contents\nThis Update brings a huge change to the way our distance and obstruction sound works across all of Warframe. All distant sounds now feel properly spatialized and obstructed sounds now have the feeling of walls and more. Each shot, each character sound, each infested squeal will now bring you a more visceral and deep sound experience.\nWe updated many weapon sounds to have elements that take advantage of this new sound system.\nArchwing has been upgraded to a full six degrees of freedom! Now, you’ll be able to pilot your Archwing like a true flight simulator with full 360 degree yaws and pitches. (Note: submersible missions will still use the old controls)\nNew Archwing UI and control bindings to further enhance your flying experience!\nNew Eximus Archwing units have been deployed throughout the Origin System!\nSyndicates now offer Archwing components!\nReduced the total number of Archwing nodes to 8 \none of each type for Grineer and Corpus.\nArchwing Pursuit (Saturn \nPandora)\nHunt down a heavily defended Grineer Ship and destroy it by fighting through the ship’s defenses, such as: energy shields, turrets, and mines.\nArchwing Rush (Phobos \nKepler)\nReach hostile supply ships and destroy them before they escape. The more ships you destroy within the given time, the greater the reward.\nGet this Archwing today in the Market or Tenno Clan Research!\nThe Warframe Market got a facelift! Two big motivators behind this rework are pretty straight-forward: a) to make it easier to find what you want and to see what’s available; and b) to allow the Market to grow as more content is added in-game. Highlights of this upgrade include better item categories (especially for Cosmetics) and a brand new search function to help you fine-tune your results. A new hide/show owned button will make browsing for new gear a breeze, but for those who need to save up for the big ticket items, the new Wishlist feature will help you keep track of your must-haves. Feeling particularly generous? You can see your friends’ Wishlists and gift them what their heart desires!\nA large majority of Market-related complaints we receive relate to the confusion between built items (aka Platinum-purchased) and Blueprints. The current Market set-up can misguide players into thinking that Warframes, Weapons, and Sentinels aren’t craftable in-game, so we condensed the Built items and Blueprints into the same page. Information about build costs, stats, blueprint location, and more, will be separated into 3 tabs on this page to help players learn all they need to know about the item in order to make an informed purchase!\n\nWhile trying to make the Market work (and look!) better, we made some pricing changes as follows:\nFrugal Credits Bundle: 50k Credits for 50 Platinum.\nHigh Roller Credit Bundle: 175k Credits for 90 Platinum.\nLoki*: 175 Platinum\nMag*: 75 Platinum\n* These prices were swapped to reflect the change in Starter status.\nReveal hidden contents\nFixed doors locking if a player enters and exits the door while the buttons are held in Stage 3 of The Law of Retribution.\nFixed a variety of weapons having improper Arsenal information on their noise type: Silent or Alarming.\nFixed missing sounds from many various Warframe idle animations.\nFixed the Fatal Acceleration Mod being usable on Kohm since it was changed to Hitscan a while ago, the Mod had no affect.\nFixed an issue with certain charge weapons not playing the correct sounds.\nFixed further issues with making purchases in the Arsenal not saving customization choices.\nFixed various issues with game freezes and crashes.\nPossible fixes for various visual effects not working for Clients.\nFixed issues with various weapon skins and attachments not behaving as intended.\nFixed Sentinels sometimes showing 'BLEEDING OUT: 0:00' on the UI when they've died, instead of just showing the proper DEAD.\nFixed possible enemy location desync issues between Host and Client for enemies on Ziplines\nFixed a variety of enemy behaviour issues that could affect game performance.\nFixed issues with poor performance when returning to your Landing Craft from missions.\nFixed an issue with 'Damaged' faction-specific damage mods all affecting Corpus even though they were for other factions.\nFixed an issue with Vauban's Bastille Visual FX staying active if the Host is killed within a Client's Bastille in Conclave.\nFixed an issue with uncontrollably shaking Kubros.\nFixed an issue with Mag’s Magnetize field absorbing Oberon’s Renewal healing orbs, preventing the healing effect from reaching teammates.\nFixed an issue with the End of Mission screen lingering after Mastery Rank tests.  \nFixed an issue with Volt’s Passive, Static Discharge, not contributing additional Electricity damage to his Electric Shields.\nFixed dual Secondary holsters clipping through Chroma when equipped with his Agile stance.\nFixed fist weapons being placed on the floor of the Arsenal when equipped on Loki's Knave skin.\nFixed certain mods not working after a Host Migration.\nFixed certain weapon holsters clipping through Nezha's back.\nFixed a rare case of Mods not activating for Clients upon loading into a mission.\nFixed seeing incorrect Warframe Deluxe skins on players who switch Warframe's in the Relay.\nFixed an issue with the water decoration in the New Loka Syndicate room not covering the whole pool.\nFixed the Arsenal camera view positioning incorrectly in the Simulacrum, Relays, while moving, and when accessing it from the menu on your Landing Craft.\nFixed the Tethra's Doom badge clipping through Warframe shoulders.\nFixed issues with energy colour choices not properly affecting a variety of projectiles.\nFixed an issue where the End of Mission screen would be stuck open after completing a rank up test from the Relay.\nFixed an issue with the visual FX of the Health Conversion Mod not reflecting the bonus' you have active.\nFixed an issue where a Magnetic Status Effect would typically lower the victim's Shields further upon expiry (rather than restore them properly) if it had re-triggered the Status Effect.\nFixed enemies getting stuck in a specific area on the Earth Defense tileset.\nFixed a possible issue with mouse-cursor accuracy on certain screens.\nFixed the Sortie Defense Target getting stuck when trying to navigate around the terrain.\nFixed an issue with Strun weapons not reloading while bullet jumping.\nFixed player list information overlapping in the HUD.\nFixed an issue with mission Challenge duplication being possible after Host

This also fixes intensified FX in this situation that caused performance issues. \nFixed Hydroid’s passive activating when punching with a fist weapon. \nFixed performance issues due to having 4+ Hyekka’s on screen.\nFixed the Aquiros Syandana hanging incorrectly. \nFixed missed discrepancy Mod descriptions. \nFixed more collisions on Orokin doors that cause players to get caught in between the gap and eaten by the door.\nFixed overlapping text of Mags abilities in the Tutorial UI.\nFixed Volt’s Electric Shield lingering for other players after disappearing for the caster.\nFixed Ash’s Arcane Locust and Arcane Scorpion Helmet not being tradable. \nFixed Ivara’s Prowl ability sound not cancelling out when casting a Focus ability.\nFixed seeing a random ‘Level Up’ notification with no context.\nPossible fix for crashing on shutdown when running DirectX 10 or 11.\nFixes Mesa’s Peacemaker effects sticking around permanently in rare situations. \nFixed numerous crashes.\n\n\n",

The following changes have been made to help create and maintain that equilibrium:\n\nSlide attacks in PvP will now only use the base damage of the melee weapon wielded. Previously, slide attacks used a damage multiplier; this was shifting the balance in a negative direction.\nRhino’s Iron Skin is no longer a permanent buff, and will begin to slowly decay after a short period of time.\nMade adjustments to Rhino’s Charge damage in PvP.\nArcane Helmets have been removed from PvP.\nMods that increase maximum clip size may now be used in PvP.\nIncreased DPS for all Primary and Secondary weapons in PvP.\nIncreased the damage of Frost’s Freeze ability in PvP.\nIncreased the range of Mag’s Pull ability in PvP.\nIncreased the amount of overshield from Mag’s Shield Polarize ability in PvP.\nReduced the damage of Volt’s Shock ability in PvP.\nReduced the damage of all Paris bows in PvP.\n\nPvP Changes\n\nUpdated water effects in Orokin Cephalon Capture level.\nRespawning Cephalons now play a sound on respawn.\nThe Gear wheel has been removed from the Conclave Arsenal menu.\n\nChanges\n\nBuilding Arcane Enhancements now costs 200k credits.\nGave Rhino’s Stomp a slight audio boost.\nRemoved dead animation time at the end of Excalibur’s Radial Javelin and radial Blind casting animations.\nTweaked various defenses in Corpus Spy vaults.\nTweaked various defenses in Grineer Spy vaults.\nAmbulas has been removed from the Sanctuary Simulacrum.\nMultiple items can now be purchased at once from the Syndicate Market UI.\nIncreased timers in Grineer Spy vaults.\nMade various environmental PBR updates to the Orokin Void and Tenno Dojo.\nIncreased the brightness of flames produced by the Ignis.\nImproved the smokey particle effects on the Embolist’s weapon fire.\nPlayers without a Synthesis Scanner equipped during a scan will no longer receive Synthesis progress.\nEnergy orbs worth 50 energy are now larger than orbs worth 25 energy.\nMade various localization updates.\nAdded casting trails on Nekros’ abilities.\n\nFixes\n\nFixed Warframes not holding a weapon in the Melee training portion of the Codex\nFixed issue causing players to respawn players with 100% health after Host migration in PvP\nFixed the Grineer Manic’s animations not properly deactivating Warframe powers, giving him unintended power immunity pre-attack.  Tackles from the Grineer Manic will now properly disable Warframe powers as intended.\nFixed Chroma’s Spectral Scream being affected by rift status.\nFixed Chroma’s Elemental Ward fire AoE being affected by rift status.\nFixed lighting effects on glowing MOA spawners in Corpus Spy vaults.\nFixed issue in Spy missions where failing the main console hack would cause the ‘data destruction’ timer to stop and be unusable for the remainder of the Mission.\nFixed players being unable to parry the Grineer Heavy Gunner’s melee slam.\nFixed being able to use 8-player squads in other non-Trial Missions.\nFixed players being able to bypass Conclave loadouts by joining Cephalon Capture via invite or entering a match via the Join in Progress button.\nFixed a light not properly casting shadows in the Grineer Spy vault.\nFixed Chroma’s Noble animations displaying a strange hand positioning.\nFixed Bo Prime not being usable in PvP.\nFixed Sanctuary’s Mastery Test practice simulations giving Credit rewards.\nFixed login error caused by conflicting update versions tagged on an account.\nFixed Chroma’s elemental Ward not properly removing ‘old’ buff when 2+ Chroma activate the ability.\nFixed an issue where players who once equipped mustaches will still have mustaches equipped when changing weapon skins within the Liset.\nFixed certain texture in CTF Gas City Map that was causing interaction issues.\nFixed accounts that had lost their loadout information upon logging in.\nFixed loadout error that could occur in PvP Arsenal.\nFixed item drops appearing from enemies in Sanctuary Simulacrum.\n",

Work with Simaris to track it down and discover its true nature.\n\nIn order to obtain this new Quest, players above Mastery Rank 5 must first visit Cephalon Simaris in his Sanctuary after completing the Stolen Dreams Quest.  From there players can acquire The New Strange and accept it from the Codex once they return to the Liset.\n\nA master of the deadly elements, Chroma can alter his damage output by changing his energy coloring.\nChroma’s powers include:\n\n\nTenno are out for vengeance, and Grineer Councilor Vay Hek has nowhere left to hide.  Hot on his trail after the assault on Relays during Eyes of Blight, the Lotus will guide a precision strike force to hunt down and put an end to Vay Hek once and for all.  Be wary Tenno.  Numbers alone will not protect you when diving into the heart of Grineer military power.\n\nCreate a squad of 4 to 8 Tenno and work through three challenge scenarios as you track down Vay Hek across the Solar System.\nEarn Arcane enhancements from defeating Vay Hek, each of which provide a unique bonus Warframes can unleash during combat.In order to equip an Arcane enhancement players must construct it in their Foundry under the Miscellaneous tab.\nPlayers will then need to select what Helmet or Syandana they would like the Arcane to be attached to.\nAfter construction the Arcane Helmet or Arcane Syandana will appear in their Arsenal under Attachments.\nThe Law of Retribution Key Blueprint is available for purchase in the marketplace for 100,000 Credits.\nThis Mission can be completed with a minimum of 4 Tenno for an additional challenge.  Enemies will not scale down in difficulty with fewer players present in the Mission.\n\nCephalon Capture is our latest PvP game mode available on the Conclave Console in the Liset, and with its arrival come a slew of new changes to our existing PvP system.  The following are a list of general changes to PvP immediately available in Update: Sanctuary:\nPlayers will only be allowed to select Warframes from an existing list of warframes balanced exclusively for PvP 2.0.  This list will be expanded upon in future Updates and currently includes:Mag\nChroma\nExcalibur\nFrost\nRhino\nVolt\nPlayers will be limited to Weapons and Mods that have balanced exclusively for PvP.  This list will be expanding upon in future Updates.\nPlayers can access their unique Conclave loadouts from the Arsenal by selecting ‘Select Mode’, followed by ‘Conclave’.\nCephalon Capture has three maps on launch that will rotate between rounds!\nCephalon Capture now features Challenges that can be unlocked while fighting against your fellow Tenno.\nWith our expansion to PvP 2.0 comes a new figure to guide Tenno through the Conclave’s trials and toward the path of enlightenment.  Teshin, a survivor of the Orokin Era, disagrees with the Lotus’ policies and strives to see Tenno break free of that which restrains their potential.\n\nTeshin and the Conclave Syndicate have established their presence in the Northern Wing of any Relay, and offer unique Syndicate rewards for Tenno who represent Teshin when participating in Conclave PvP.\n\nIn the cradle of space on Tenno Relays across the Solar System Cephalon Simaris has constructed a Sanctuary with the goal of eternally preserving all life.  But Simaris needs your help, Tenno.  Using Simaris’ advanced Synthesis Scanner you must track down unique targets to scan in a Codex shared by Tenno all over the world, and help unlock exciting new lore and Syndicate rewards.\nSimaris is a Neutral Syndicate and can be joined by any Tenno regardless of current Syndicate allegiance.\nSynthesis Scanners can be equipped like regular Gear, and are used in the same fashion a Codex scanner is.\nRunning a Mission that features a targeted enemy will prompt a notification from Simaris, making it a little easier to hunt targets.\nEnemies scanned will be tracked by Simaris unlock a global Codex of lore, in addition to providing affinity toward Simaris’ unique Syndicate rewards.\nWhile playing in Missions Rare Spawn enemies with unique abilities may appear.  These enemies will be more

After a couple years of talk, we finally were able to set up a Test cluster which could be accessed externally. This Test cluster housed the many iterations of Update 16 content.\n\nFor 1 week straight leading up to this update, a group of just under 20 veteran Tenno spent hours and hours each day playing together, giving feedback, finding bugs, and voicing concerns. Each day included tireless attempts at the incredibly difficult Raids, hilarious moments competing in PvP, and general exploration of all things new. This past week has been one for the memory books \nabout 60+ hours together with veteran Tenno who applied their skill to some of our hardest and most surprising content yet. I loved every minute of it, and I can’t wait to see what we can do for quality with the potential that this Test cluster has opened!\nRebecca\n",

  "changes": "Tenno Reinforcements:\n\n\n\nAkjagara Dual Pistols and Uru Sugatra available now!\n\nThe design of these hard-hitting dual pistols is a mix of organic and bladed elements.\n\nExpressing the martial finesse and skill of its master, the Uru Sugatra complements the Uru Syandana used in the Tenno Absolution Ceremony.\n\nGet these new in-game additions by visiting the Market today!\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the Arcane Codices?\n\nA new character and a completely revamped version of Spy Mode await you in the Stolen Dreams Quest. Embrace your inner secret agent, Tenno!\n\nThe Grineer have put out a capture order for a thief named Maroo – they claim she double crossed them and has sold precious Arcane Codices to the Corpus. Concerned for Maroo’s safety – and excited at the idea of a new Arcane Codex – the Lotus is requesting that you bring Maroo in.\n\nThink fast, Tenno! You must plan your actions quickly and accordingly in this Quest. Failure to do so may alert the enemy to your presence and the Arcane Codex data may be destroyed.\n\nComplete this Quest and you’ll be rewarded with an Ether Dagger Blueprint and a Catalyst Blueprint.\n\nThis new Quest is available for all players Mastery Rank 3 or greater.\n\n\nWhile our old Spy game mode certainly had small spy-like focus in stealing intel, most of the time players were happy to loudly murder their way through the enemy to get the job done.  Who could blame anyone?  That’s why we sat down and gave Spy a total overhaul.\n\nWith new elements focused on avoiding laser grids and sneaking past guards, stealth is paramount in Spy 2.0.  Being detected will mean losing rewards and bonus Affinity, even when the Mission is complete.\n\nThe following nodes have been updated to include this new Spy game mode:\n\nMercury \nSuisei\nVenus \nVesper, Unda\nMars \nMartialis\nJupiter \nAdrastea\nSaturn \nTitan, Aegaeon\nUranus \nUmbriel, Rosalind\nNeptune \nSao, Laomedeia\nPluto \nOceanum\nCeres \nLex, Hapke\nEris \nCyath, Gnathos\nSedna \nTikoloshe, Scylla\nEuropa \nArmaros, Valac\nPhobos \nGrildrig, Shklovsky\n\n\nJoining our updated Spy 2.0 are some exciting improvements to stealth combat!  Players will now find that sneaking around each Mission may come with some excellent rewards.  These alterations to stealth gameplay will continue to evolve based upon player feedback, but for now stealth aficionados can sink their teeth into the following changes:\n\n\n\nWe’ve made a wide variety of improvements to Warframe in some obvious, and not-so-obvious ways.  The following is a quick list of changes we’ve made, and where you’ll notice them the most!\n\n\n\nThe following Mission Nodes on the Star Chart have had missing and mismatched rewards fixed.\n\nCeres \nBode (Capture)\nPhobos \nLimtoc, Todd (Capture)\nUranus \nTrinculo (Capture)\nEuropa \nValefor (Excavation)\nEuropa \nZagan, Morax (Exterminate)\nEris \nViver (Hive)\nSedna \nUndine (Sabotage)\nEuropa \nGamygyn (Sabotage)\nIn addition, changes have been made for Defense, Survival, Mobile Defense, Exterminate and Rescue.  Previously these Missions were not properly balanced to reflect the Mission's enemy levels, sometimes resulting in fewer enemies than intended in higher level Missions and more at lower level Missions.\n\n\nTo simulate waves and grouped up enemies, previously survival enemy spawns cycled on and off for short periods of time.  While it was a simple way of adding the desired pacing, we found that it was possible for players to get 'in sync' with killing enemies at certain times which left gaps of time where there were no enemies to kill and no enemies spawning, especially in higher level Missions with four players.\n\nSpawning now fluctuates dynamically with each enemy spawned.  Max spawn rate is the same, but it's now the time between individual enemy spawns which changes instead of a blanket 'on' or 'off' state for all enemy spawning.  Hopefully you will start to see more consistent spawning in higher level Missions with four players, as well as squads of enemies attacking together.  In our tests we found that there wasn't a notable difference in low level Missions.\n\nSmall life support drop rate was tweaked to compensate for the changes.\nAlthough we have playtested extensively, we are always interested in your feedback.  Please be sure to let us know how these changes may have affected your gameplay experience in the appropriate subforum: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/forum/237-mission/\n\nStar Chart node changes have been made to balance the available nodes across factions, tilesets and difficulty.  The following nodes have received changes:\n\nSaturn \nKeeler: Changed Survival node to Grineer Asteroid Mobile Defense\nSaturn\n Cassini: Changed to Asteroid tileset (was Galleon)\nPhobos \nFlimnap: New Survival Grineer Asteroid node (was Deception)\nEuropa \nZagan: New Survival Corpus ship (was Exterminate)\nNeptune \nDespina: New Survival Corpus ship (was Defense)\nCeres \nNuovo: Changed to Galleon tileset (was Shipyards tileset)\n\n\nShields and HP are two critical elements to keep track of in Warframe, but when fighting enemies it can be difficult to keep track of how much damage you’ve taken in the heat of combat.  This Update contains new visual and audio cues for when your Warframe takes damage in combat.\n\nWhen taking damage in combat damage will sound different depending on if your shields are down or intact.  Additionally shields ‘breaking’ have a new audio cue to help you better keep track of when your health is exposed to enemy fire.\n\nAdditional Sound Adjustments\n\nThis Update includes multiple improvements to sound immersion.  Among these changes are:\n\n·         Improved audio on bullet impact, making it easier to hear where shots as passing by (or where your rounds are being spent).\n·         Improvements to the Grakata's audio.\n·         Sliding will now provide different sound effects, depending on what surface the player is on.\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of variables that go into making an NPC more or less deadly, and accuracy plays a huge role in what enemies are most feared.  These new adjustments to enemy accuracy will dramatically change how players handle foes.\n\nEach enemy will have increased (or decreased) odds of hitting a player based on the type of weapon they’re using.  Sniper rifles, for example, will have higher accuracy at long range but will be more difficult for NPCs to use in close-range combat.  Not only that, but our new system allows us to create custom draw rates that make some weapons more difficult for enemies to aim quickly with.\n\nThese changes represent an ongoing state of development for our NPC accuracy; and we welcome player feedback on this subtle, under-the-hood change to be made in the appropriate subforum.  For more information on our accuracy adjustments please check the following thread in our Developer Workshop: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/395422-npc-accuracy/\n\n\nSaryn’s Molt will now transfer enemies that ‘latch on’ to Warframes (Brood Mother Maggots, Swarm Moa Swarms, etc) instead of destroying them.\nOberon’s Hallowed Ground will no longer create a second AoE effect on a second cast when the Hallowed Eruption Mod is equipped.\nCasting Frost’s Snow Globe inside of a Snow Globe you previously created will combine the health of both globes, eliminating the old Globe in the process. This will allow for greater combat visibility as your view won’t be obscured by opaque stacked Snow-Globe walls!\nFrost Prime’s Ice Wave now has a bit of Prime flair to its visual effect.\nMag Prime’s Crush now has a bit of Prime flair to its visual effect.\nIncreased damage bonus to Excalibur’s Furious Javelin Mod.\nUpdated audio and visual FX on Volt’s Shock Ability.  \nThe following Augment Mods have had their duration increased from 24 seconds to 40 seconds, and their damage reduced from 125% to 100%Ember's Fireball Frenzy\nFrost’s Freeze Force\nOberon’s Smite Infusion\nSaryn’s Venom Dose\nVolt’s Shock Trooper\nNova’s Neutron Star Augment now has a max  range of 8 meters, in addition to some slight camera shake for effect.\nMade minor visual and audio FX changes to Frost’s Avalanche ability.\nRemoved the initial radial damage of Ember’s Fire Blast, damage and the Heat proc now occur on the shockwave as it expands.\nRemoved the white flash that occurs when transitioning into Loki’s Invisibility.\nSyndicate Medallions have been increased to provide 500, 1000 or 5000 Standing depending on Medallion rarity.\n\n\nItzal Archwing’s Support Drones will now gain the same color tints of the Archwing.\nThe ‘bounce’ effect that occurs when hitting an object has been reduced.  This should help eliminate any pinballing when hitting a wall in close-quarters.\n\n\nAuto-turrets will now be open on spawn.\nAdded health bars to Wyrmius bosses.\n\n\nSyndicate Daily Quests for Standing have received an Affinity overhaul!  These changes should make Syndicate Missions much more rewarding to complete, in addition to decreasing the Daily Syndicate Standing Cap for non-Syndicate missions.\n\nSyndicate Daily Missions now give double the Standing they did previously.\nDaily Standing caps for non-Syndicate missions for have been reduced by half (remember, this cap is determined by Mastery Rank).  For example:MR 0 could earn 2000 Standing before, now 1000.\nMR 1 could earn 4000 Standing before, now 2000.\nMR 2 could earn 6000 Standing before, now 3000.\nSyndicate Mission Medallions have new standing values:\nCommon Medallions are now worth 500 Standing\nUncommon Medallions are now worth 1000 Standing\nRare Medallions are still worth 5000 Standing\n\n\nThe following changes have been made to the Rakta Ballistica.  Future adjustments may continue to be made, and feedback on any weapon are encouraged to be posted in the appropriate subforum.\n\nRakta Ballistica’s crit chance has been buffed from 15 to 20 on charge.\nRatka Ballistica’s damage on charge has been changed to 5 Slash, 5 Impact, 90 Puncture.\n\n\nLighting adjustments have been made to Tenno Relays.\nVarious art updates have been made to Tenno Relays.\nReduced the number of locked co-op doors in the Corpus Gas City tileset for Rescue and Intel game types.\nThe Tar-Mutalist Moa, Sapping Osprey and Infested Alad V will now have their damage scale based on their level.\nImprovements have been made to glass and distortion effects in game!\nSinister Reach will now extend the Amprex’s chain lightning effect.\nUpdated sound effects on player and NPC footsteps.\nThe Lynx is now immune to Mind Control effects.\nMade various background art updates to Corpus Archwing Sabotage and Exterminate Missions.\nUpdated the Deep Freeze Mod to give up to 90% Freeze damage to match other elemental Mods.\nUpdated the North Wind and Shocking Touch Mods to give up to 90% damage to match other elemental Mods.\nAttempting to convert an Arcane Helmet will now display a warning message to confirm your decision.\nUpdated Natural Talent to now be a Rare Mod on Interception drop tables.\nAdjusted Ducat selling price of common Prime Parts from 50 to 10.\nIncreased the amount of Fusion Cores you get in Void Survival Rewards depending on tier of Survival being played.\nAdded a 3 x Orokin Cells to TIII Survival Rewards.                                                                                             \nSome Mission Ndes have been changed to the Grineer Galleon tileset (previously, Grineer Asteroid).\nThe bloom on Mutalist Incursion Tactical Alert Badges has been reduced.\nReduced particle effect trails for Kohm’s projectiles.\nPlayer HUD and targeting reticule will no longer display in Relays.\nWall running instructions in the beginning tutorial should now be easier to read and see.\nMission Extraction cinematics will now cancel all emotes and actions.\nVarious NPC changes have been made within Syndicates, adding more life to those who live there.\nNightmare Mode nodes now have an updated Icon on the Star Chart.\nMade audio improvements to Mission Transmissions.\nAdjusted the Kohm to shoot a maximum of 5 pellets, in addition to dropping the fire rate but boosting projectile damage to compensate for dps.  This should keep the Kohm’s damage relatively unchanged, while helping cut down on the graphical latency caused by the weapon.\nThe World State Window will now show quests that you can start, in addition to incomplete quests.\nAdded large viewing screens to the Relay Concourse.  \nNew Rescue Mission on Jupiter.\nPhobos Rescue tile was reworked for Rescue 2.0.\nRescue hostages will now stick closer to players, instead of moving at their own pace.\nRebalanced the MK1 Paris easier to use with comparable damage to the MK1 Braton.  \nVoid Mobile Defense maps have been reduced in size to cut down on the amount of travel Tenno need to do.\nSlightly reduced the Shield Osprey’s beam radius.\nRemoved puddle of water that would occur around ice floor panel in Void tilesets.\n\n",

We have just detected a Balor Fomorian traveling on an interception course with Vesper Relay. The beast moves slowly but if we allow it to get within firing range, it will surely obliterate our new Relay. We need to destroy it before that happens.\nIntelligence reports state that the Balor Fomorian’s power core emits a thick energy field composed of deadly omega radiation. In order to break through the field you will need to craft this Fomorian Disruptor. It will allow you to safely approach the core and when activated it will temporarily disrupt the core allowing you to inflict damage.\nTake note Tenno, the Disruptor is forged using recently discovered Omega Isotopes. These are a by-product of a Fomorian’s core and will only appear in and around planets with a Fomorian present.\nMove quickly Tenno, this is the first Balor Fomorian attack but it won’t be the last. When the others come we must be ready.\n\n\nThe Lotus\n\n\n\nFomorian Vessels will intermittently appear in the Solar System as event nodes. These event nodes will be locked until you have the Fomorian Disruptor in your Consumable Inventory.\n\nYou will receive a Blueprint from the Lotus for the Fomorian Disruptor. It will require Nano Spores, Cryotic, and Omega Isotopes to craft.\n\nBuild your Disruptor in the Foundry and equip it in your Gear Menu to start the Fomorian Sabotage Mission.\n\nOnce in the Mission, fly to the Fomorian. Once you’re close enough to the Fomorian you must disable the exterior Shield Cores so you can enter the ship.\n\nThe Fomorian’s internal Shield Generators are protected by a magnetic field. Use your Fomorian Disruptor from the Gear menu to disrupt the magnetic field, and temporarily expose the Shield Generators, allowing you to destroy them.\n\nWith the Shield Generators destroyed you can now deal damage to the ship’s Main Reactor Power Cores.\n\nAfter damaging the cores, escape to safety outside the Fomorian.\n\n\n\nCompleting a successful Sabotage run will earn you event points, and reduce the global health of the Fomorian.\n\nYour Fomorian Disruptor will be consumed after completing the Fomorian Sabotage mission.\n\nThis Operation is on now until Monday, January 5 at 12 PM EST.\n\n\n\nCompleting the Fomorian Sabotage mode successfully will earn you one Battle Point.\n\nYou can earn a maximum of one Battle Point per Fomorian. Repeating the same Fomorian will not generate additional Battle Points. These points will count towards individual rewards.\n\nFomorian missions with a higher level of difficulty will provide extra points.\nLeaderboards are available for players that want to compete for the best score during Fomorian Sabotage Missions. Your individual score is determined by the amount of damage dealt to the Fomorian Power Core during a single run. The highest scores can only be achieved by squads with coordinated deployment of Fomorian Disruptors, and efficient attacks on the Power Cores.\n\n\nClan Scoring considers the following:\n\nYour score will be based on the most damage dealt to the Fomorian Power Core in a given mission. Clan score is sum of personal best but divided by max clan size for that tier (ie: 10 for Ghost Clan, 1000 for Moon).\n\n\n\n3 BATTLE POINTS: Eyes of Blight Skin Pack (Badge + Rahk Fluctus Skin)\n10 BATTLE POINTS: Eyes of Blight Mod Pack (Magma Chamber + Searing Steel)\n15 BATTLE POINTS: Imperator Vandal\n\nClan Scoring: The Top three Clans in each tier will be awarded with Gold, Silver and Bronze Statues.\nTake down the Fomorian Ships, Tenno!\n\n\n\nPlayers can check out the Leaderboards for Operation Eyes of Blight here: http://content.warframe.com/dynamic/eyesOfBlight.php\n\nLeaderboards are updated every 15 minutes for Clans, and every 5 minutes for players.  Good luck, and may the best Tenno win!\n\nOmega Isotopes: Produced by a Fomorian’s power core, these particles only appear on planets where a Fomorian is present.  Omega Isotopes can only be obtained in non-Archwing missions where a Fomorian vessel is present.\n\n\n\nFixed Soma Prime and Vasto Prime not being visible in the Codex.\nFixed duplicate Stance Mods appearing in Codex as per: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/369502-duplicated-entries-on-the-mod-codex-shield-disruption-and-cleaving-whirlwind/\nFixed the Breach Loader Mod showing an incorrect description in the Arsenal.\nFixed audio issue when interrupting the Supra mid-reload.\nFixed non-Archwing Pistol and Shotgun Mods appearing in Archwing Missions.\nFixed the word ‘SCANNING’ appearing in the Codex for non-localized descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

  "changes": "Additions:\n\nAdded Rank display to item browsing, meaning you can now see what rank your gear is in the inventory. As an example, in the scenario of building an Aklex and you have three, one which is Rank 30, you can now see the item's rank in this new display!\nUnlisted 14.6.0 change: There is now a Dojo chat tab when in the Dojo!\n\n\nTrinity's Blessing is now recastable while passive damage reduction is active. This means you no longer need to wait for your Duration timers to expire before being able to recast Blessing.\n\nFirstly, an explanation in intent and next steps:\nDev observed and experienced the uninhibited blinding effect in up to a 60 M Range with several environments coming between Excalibur and targets. This prompted review.\nSecondly, the 14.6.0 changes have all been reverted as they were experimental and not intended to function in the way they did for this brief 12 hour window.\nThirdly, what you can expect down the road is Radial Blind functioning in a way that considers Line-of-sight. The 14.6.0 unintended version suffered from a lot of problems with this approach, and coming will be radically improved line-of-sight checks for Radial Blind. Targets behind cover that can still see Excalibur are blinded. Other bodies won’t inhibit their blindness, but walls will.\n\n\nFirst, a quick brief in the history of changes this Mod has undergone:\nThis Mod was originally fixed to not give a player energy for damage that was never dealt to player. When we added the damage predeath state in Conclaves, etc, the original fix was unintentionally reverted.\nThe 14.6.0 fix resolves issues where Rage + Quick Thinking gave effective permanent invulnerability because energy was being added to pool that was never dealt to player. With this change in mind, the combination of Rage and Quick Thinking may seem less efficient as before due to no longer giving effective invulnerability. The scope of this change is being monitored to ensure the usefulness of these Mods as a combination.\n\n\nChanged loading screen/matchmaking logic to move on if after 10 seconds Client is unable to properly join/connect. Elaboration: Fixes entire squad being stuck on loading screen while waiting for low end PC to load.\nChanged the attack ferocity of Corpus Mine Osprey: before no maximum existed on number of deployed mines, and now there is a maximum of 6.\nRemoved Kubrow roaming in Liset until further notice.\nTweaked performance of Local Reflections code on Dx10 and Dx11 to address potential FPS loss.\nPvP Bladestorm balancing:-Reduced maximum number of attacks to [2, 3, 4, 5] to address issues with players getting stuck in Bladestorm-ed state for up to 15+ hits.-Increased the PvP damage multiplier from 0.1 per hit to 0.5 per hit in an effort to keep damage output in line with previous values.\n",
  "fixes": "\nFixed issue with Captain Vor being unbeatable on Mercury.\nFixed an issue with Nova’s Molecular Prime explosions caused by self-destructing enemies damaging teammates and defense objectives.\nFixed issues with users connecting behind proxies being unable to update the game.\nFixed an issue where Lotus would constantly talk to you at the end of Survival Alerts.\nFixed a game freeze that would occur when attempting to fuse or change mods.\nFixed game freeze when focusing on the categories menu after opening the item browsing screen in Foundry.\nFixed interception console ‘hitswitch’ pushing AI through the terrain on Grineer maps.\nFixed navigation issues that prevented faithful Kubrow from joining in the fight against Lephantis.\nFixed issues with Void missions not pausing when playing Solo and hitting ESC.\nFixed several crashes.\n",

  "changes": "Update 14.5:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPERATION CRYOTIC FRONT\n\nDig for valuable Artifacts!\n\n\n\nA message from a Mystery Associate:\n\n\n\nTenno,\n\n\n\nI do hope you will forgive my concealed identity but dealing in these unsavoury circles demands unusual discretion.\n\nI’m such a big fan of the Tenno, you’ve accomplished so much and with such rudimentary equipment. That’s why I’m concerned about the coming Balor Fomorians. I think we both know your Warframes are simply not sophisticated enough to stop them.\n\nBut I can help you... for a price.\n\nYou see, I have an appetite for the rare and extraordinary and I’ve recently learned of a fine substance known as Cryotic. If you are willing, I will supply the necessary equipment and coordinates for its extraction. In return, I will enlighten you with what I know about technology that could defeat this Balor threat.\n\nTo sweeten the deal I am even willing award bonuses to those of you who exhibit outstanding performance.\n\nI must say, some of you display the inklings of good taste, if our partnership is a success perhaps we will get to know each other better.\n\nRegards,\n\nYour New Associate\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay the new Excavation missions!\n\n\nThe Location of a ‘Scanning Device’ will appear on your minimap for you to locate.\n\n\nCollect Power Cells dropped by enemies, and bring them to the Scanner to activate it and keep it powered. You can track your Scanner’s power in the map on your HUD. If it reaches 0%, the process will stall until power is restored.\n\n\nDefend the Scanner as it searches for a dig site. Once the Scanner has found a site, it will appear on your map. Proceed to that location to find an Excavator that is digging for artifacts.\n\n\nTake caution!  Enemy waves will attempt to destroy the Excavator, and you must defend it. The Excavator will also continue to lose power. As with the Scanner, you must collect Power Cells to keep it activated.\n\n\nOnce the Excavator has uncovered the artifact, you may choose to Extract from the operation or wait for another Scanner and repeat the process.\n\n\nThere are three available Tilesets for this Operation.\n\n\nWhat is CRYOTIC (New Resource)?\n\nUsually found in extreme sub-zero environments, Cryotic instantly freezes anything it comes in contact with.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Excavator is destroyed before it recovers an item, the mission is a failure.\n\n\nThe Operation is on now until Wednesday, September 3 at 12 PM EDT.\n\n\nOperation Cryotic Front is the first introduction of a new mission type that will replace all Survival missions that take place on a terrestrial tileset.\n\n\nThis Operation introduces Cryotic, a new resource that will only be available in the Excavation game mode.\n\n\nAt each of the point levels below and you’ll unlock a new Tileset in the Operation. It’s your choice – continue to dig on Earth or take your efforts to these new areas. Note that each new Tileset will hold more difficult enemies but will provide the opportunity to earn points faster.\n\n\n\n\nWith each successful dig, you will receive an amount of Cryotic based on your performance (100 max.) The more Cryotic you earn, the better the Reward – so dig on!\n\nMore than 500 pts = Event Badge\n\nMore than 1000 pts = Ice Mod Set (4 dual-stat mods)\n\nMore than 3000 pts = Latron Wraith and the Polar Glaxion skin\n\n\n\nNote: The basis for the rewards is your best score in one single run.\n\n\n\n\nThe top three Clans per Clan Tier will receive Gold, Silver, and Bronze Trophies. For Clan Leaderboards, a Clan’s score is the sum of active personal bests.\n\nPlease be aware that people joining clans after the event has started will not contribute to their new clans score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Added new Colour Customization options available through 2 new packs! These packs are brand new colours that can be applied to your current Kubrow patterns!\n\n• Added a base palette pack that includes 5 colors you can play with for 100K credits!\n\n• Kubrows are now in free-roam mode on the Liset!\n\n• Price of DNA Stabilizers reduced from 100k to 75k credits.\n\n• Added a “Consign to the Lotus” button for unwanted Kubrows.  Fear not, the Lotus shall take care of them!\n\n• Additional animations for Kubrow Cubs!\n\n• Added Kubrow filters for Mods.\n\n\n\n\n\nArmor:\n\n• Oberon’s base Armor increased to 150.\n\n\n\nSmite:\n\n• Projectiles that are spawned after impact seek-to-target, not just spawned in direction.\n\n• Speed up projectiles by 50%.\n\n• Forced Radiation proc on the initial target.\n\n• Forced Knock-down on initial target instead of stumble.\n\n• Forced Puncture proc on all enemies hit.\n\nHallowed Ground:\n\n• Allies within Hallowed Ground can not be proc’ed.\n\n• Hallowed Ground will remove all existing procs from Allies.\n\n• Armour boosted by 5/10/15/20% per rank for all Allies on Hallowed Ground, with stacking being explored on multiple casts.\n\nRenewal:\n\n• Switch to toggle ability with smaller base cost and energy per second active drain. All Renewal benefits occur when projectile reaches target ally.\n\n• Boost Heal amount 200/250/300/400 per rank.\n\n• When target is fully healed, remove any active proc effects.\n\n• Allies affected by Renewal have slowed bleedout by 20/25/35/45% per rank. This is affected by duration mods.\n\nReckoning:\n\n• Forced Radiation Proc added to damage on targets.\n\n• Small radial blind added to slam impact, but only for enemies that survive the damage of the cast. This radial blind will be applied to enemies that move into range after it’s been cast and are blinded by the impact of those being slammed by Reckoning!\n\n\n\n\n• Made Vauban's Vortex scale with power range and duration mods.\n\n\n\n\n• Nyx’s Absorb has had it’s passive energy drain significantly reduced from 10 energy per second to 4 energy per second, and instead now has an energy drain based on incoming damage. This drain is 8 energy per 1000 damage. These drainage values are affected with the use of mods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• In an effort to compensate for more useful attribution of XP when triggering a chain reaction with Molecular Prime, the main XP is attributed to whoever started the chain reaction. Before, Nova would take the bulk of the attribution. Now,  the \"weapon and instigator\" carry through the whole explosion chain ( if Player A casts Molecular Prime and Player B blows up the room, Player B gets the kills and XP). Similarly, if Player A casts Molecular Prime to Crowd-Control and then use their slowed state to get a nice bow-shot, Player B get weapon XP.\n\n• Fixed some of the cases where two Nova's casting Molecular Prime would have unexpected results (explosion range and strength were always determined by the Nova who cast most recently).\n\n\n\n\n• Added HUD counter for Rhino Stomp to show how much longer you have left on your CC (and how long to wait until re-stomp).\n\n\n\n\n• Banshee's Sonar, and the Enemy Radar/Sense mods ignore security cameras and turrets.\n\n• Banshee’s Sonar now uses Energy Colour.\n\n\n\n\n• Saryn’s Miasma can now be cast mid-air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Changed FX of Laser Doors when affected by Mirage’s abilities to better indicate you’re safe to run through.\n\n• Update several Foley sounds: more updates to Tenno step, fixed rhythm and step events for wall running.\n\n• Updated Host Election code to work with new squad system (had been disabled since Update 14).\n\n• Added more details to error messages for invitation and join problems (we are hoping that more information will help us isolate any remaining problems with the invitation system).\n\n\n\n",
  "fixes": "\n\n\n• Fixed the UI still showing stats for a “Charge Attack” when looking at Melee weapons.\n\n• Fixed friends and clan sessions panel showing invite-only or objective-reached sessions (aka unjoinable and merely teasing.)\n\n• Fixed all consumable restoration totems (Energy, Health, etc) not travelling with you on elevators when you ascend or descend.\n\n• Fixed Player’s game freezing for short periods when decorations complete while in the Dojo.\n\n• Fixed Dendra armor colour not updating until you leave the attachments part of the Arsenal. This should also fix Ember’s FX, Nova’s helmets, Frost’s jets, Ember Prime’s flaming Mohawk, and the Silva & Aegis.\n\n• Fixed Silva & Aegis Codex Diorama not having proper fire effects.\n\n• Fixed Sentinel vibrating when riding in an elevator.\n\n• Fixed several navigation holes across numerous tilesets, particularly in places where Infested would get stuck.\n\n• Fixed for Kubrow pet spawning behind player for intro cinematic when spawning in a mission.\n\n• Fixed several issues with controller navigation on Big Picture.\n\n• Fixed several localization issues across several languages.\n\n• Multiple crash & game freeze fixes.\n\n• Fixed opening View Mission Progress while an elevator is moving will cause the camera to stay in one place until View Mission Progress is closed.\n\n• Fixed issue with player’s HUDs failing upon reviving.\n\n• Fixed Mirage’s Hall of Mirrors not being affected by some mods (Heavy Caliber).\n\n• Fixed Clients being stuck on the ‘Please Wait’ spinner when accepting an invite or joining through friends list.\n\n• Fixed players being able to invite anyone to Conclave sessions regardless of Conclave ratings.\n\n• Fixed issues where Kubrow loyalty would not be restored if the pet interaction did not play.\n\n• Fixed issues with stale and latent sessions occurring with Dojo matchmaking when users join rail editing sessions.\n\n• Fixed issues in Infested Mobile Defense where the gas that damages the player at the 2nd defense point also damages the objective you must defend.\n\n• Fixed issues with the “/invite” not working correctly when doing session checks.\n\n• Fixed issues with the Pyra Syandana falling in front of the Warframe when viewed from the back.\n\n• Fixed issues with Alert Defense missions on the Galleon tileset spawning multiple Defense targets.\n\n• Fixed Extractor counts in the Foundry displays as \"1 owned\" when the player has multiple extractors of that type in their inventory.\n\n• Fixed an issue where the player could leave critical actions unbound when changing their key bindings during the tutorial.\n\n• Fixed issue when a resource falls into a teleport volume it will remain down where it fell for Clients.\n\n• Fixed Helios endlessly rescanning things not in the Codex. Specific examples: void turrets, arc traps, Grineer laser sensors above doors, smashable grates & fans.\n\n• Fixed issue with Dex Furis muzzle flash not being customizable.\n\n• Fixed issues with consumables purchased through Arsenal not being automatically equipped.\n\n• Fixed player completing a Rank Up Test and their Mastery Level will not update right away on the Player's Profile Box at the top of the Pause Menu\n\n• Fixed an issue where you could rapidly hit the button to toggle the chat window while transitioning out of any diegetic screen in the Ship UI, and sometimes it would half-open the chat window and leave the screen darkened\n\n• Fixed issue if when the player is in the rail management screen, and they press the pause menu button, the pause menu will open behind the rail management screen. However once they do this they will be unable to close the pause menu as well be unable to exit the rail management screen.\n\n• Fixed issue where Crit damage and Crit chance are not increased by mods for Sentinel weapons.\n\n• Fixed issues with overlapping text in solar rail deployments.\n\n• Fixed an issue where the player could attempt to bring up the pause menu while viewing any part of the Codex, which led to an inconsistent UI experience. Now attempting to open the pause menu while in the Codex will function the same as if the player wishes to back out of the current screen.\n\n• Fixed issue where it would become possible to lose functionality in certain Dark Sector conflict scenarios.\n\n• Fixed issue where players could finish the tutorial without gaining any XP in gear causing account issues later on.\n\n• Fixed issues with long Kubrow names clipping outside stasis slots.\n\n• Fixed rank-up tests being rendered unbeatable if proper loadout isn`t active, no prompts inform user of necessary loadout.\n\n• Fixed issue where if a players rejoins a lobby after having previously run out of revives in that same lobby, they will not properly be put into spectator mode and will be have no functionality until the other players complete the mission.\n\n• Fixed an issue where the MatchMaking drop down list was still visible in the Clan screen when opened from within the Solar Map (causing duplicate button callouts and leaving no way to change the Clan member list's sort method.)\n\n• Fixed Infested Ancients and Grineer Scorpions from using their grapple pull ability on Saryn's Molt avatar and Loki's Decoy avatar as it would not behave well (would have them pause for a few moments, if Molt was used again it would script error and break the enemy). This also fixes a similar issue with Vay Hek’s beam-zap attack.\n\n• Fixed issues with Sentinel ‘Weapon Slot’ behavior in Arsenal when switching between Sentinels and Kubrows.\n\n• Fixed issues with blank “Trigger” types in the UI for Penta, Castanas and Deconstructor.\n\n• Fixed issues with navigating the UI with arrow keys equipping things unintentionally \narrow key navigation in Arsenal has been disabled.\n\n• Fixed issue where performing any melee action, then using a context action (Hack Console, Revive Ally), would result in an additional melee action after the context action was complete.\n",
