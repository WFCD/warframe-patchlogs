  "changes": "The Jovian Concord: Update 25.2.0:\n\nHealth increased from 100 to 150 (at max rank increased from 300 to 450).\nShield decreased from 125 to 100 (at max rank decreased from 375 to 300).\nWhy? Since Wukong’s new kit now involves an Armour buff, relying more on his Health will enable a better synergy.\nEnergy increased from 100 to 120 (at max rank 150 to 180).\nSprint increased from .95 to 1.0.﻿\nImproved his Primary/Secondary Energy blend on his Helmet tails.\nUpdated Wukong’s Arsenal Ability videos to reflect his Revisited abilities. \nReplaced existing Wukong tips with tips based on his revisited abilities.\nWukong evaporates into a fast-moving cloud of mist that will temporarily daze and paralyze enemies in his path. While in his cloud of mist, Cloud Walker has the additional mechanic of healing Wukong and his clone.\nHis movement can be interrupted by attacking at any time.\nCloud Walker has a much faster cast time which will no longer hold Wukong in place.\nWukong will no longer trigger laser traps or doors while using Cloud Walker.\nEnergy cost for Cloud Walker has been lowered.\nDefy will now taunt enemies while Wukong and his clone gain temporary invulnerability with reduced movement speed. All damage is captured, stored, and dealt back in a single furious long range staff spin attack.\nBased on the amount of damage prevented by Defy, Wukong and his clone will receive a temporary armour buff.\nPress ability again to trigger spin early.\nPrimal Fury will feature a new specialized and streamlined combo for Wukong’s legendary Iron Staff. As a preview of the upcoming Melee 3.0 system, Wukong’s Primal Fury uses new combo routes with simplified inputs providing a safe, limited space to try out coming releases.\nDamage for Wukong and his clone is redistributed for a more powerful feel, with a much higher status chance, larger base range, and some slash.\nCasting no longer holds Wukong in place. With new energy requirements, the cast cost of Primal Fury was lowered but cast drain was increased to be turned off and on as desired.\nAnimation has been trimmed.\nThe range of Wukong’s Iron Staff is always long, comparable to top range Zaws, and no longer needs to build combo to scale range.\nPlease visit our Dev Workshop post to read more about the reasons for these changes:\n\nMade micro-optimizations to dozens of UI scripts.\nMade micro-optimization when handling loot that falls into teleport pits.\nImproved handling of corrupt cache and malfunctioning graphics drivers.\nImproved error handling for failures to teleport people out of pits.\nImproved handling of corrupt download caches.\nImproved handling of crashing graphics drivers.\nRefactored runaway loop detection for improved performance.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed ability to choose any Relic type on any Void Fissure mission by queueing with squad.\nFixed Kela De Thaym not coming back down after completing the puzzle step which resulted in an infinite loop of firing missiles and Kela throwing insults at you. \nFixed ability to gain Set Mod bonus by using multiple copies of the same Mod if you have a Sentinel or Moa. Set Mod bonuses require different Mods from the Set to gain the bonus.\nFixed ‘Everything Old is New Again’ and ‘Loyalty’ Nightwave Acts not awarding Standing.\nFixed the ‘Silent Eliminator’ Nightwave Act not failing when an enemy detects you, regardless of alarms. Step your stealth game up!\nFixed Harrow’s Last Covenant Augment bonus time from headshots only appearing in the UI buff section (top right), not the Ability bar, where Ability would simply become \"in use\".\nFixed Mirage Sleight of Hand not working with Gas City objects.\nFixed Archwing enemy markers not showing more than 5 at once.\nFixed having 6 unranked Mods in the Trade slots appearing as fully rank after \"the slots are full\" message prompted, and accepting the Trade results in giving 1 max-ranked same Mod away instead of 6 unranked Mods, even when you didn't swap it.\nFixed Domestik Drones not spawning when returning from the Simulacrum.\nFixed a level hole in the Plains of Eidolon as reported here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/c0anj0/ay_yo_what_the_heck/\nFixed a level hole in the Orb Vallis tileset.\nFixed Equinox’s Duality Augment clone running off ledges so frequently.\nFixed 'Loot corpse' context action was not disappearing for Clients in the Gas City tileset.\nFixed cases where the Capture target will not make attempts to escape in the Gas City tileset.\nFixed Gas Traps not replicating SFX / VFX for Clients in the Gas City tileset.\nFixed the bright white FX projector on Electrical Melee FX.\nFixed the Bow Dryad Skin having misaligned strings when equipped on the Lenz.\nFixed missing Melee front-finisher sounds for the Tatsu.\nFixed zipline slide sound looping forever open dismount.\n",

  "changes": "Upon picking up a Datamass, a Melee to gun swap will automatically equip your Secondary weapon instead of your Primary weapon, which would make you drop the Datamass.\nPressing F when in Melee mode now switches you back to your \"other\" weapon. For example, if your Primary weapon is equipped when you trigger a Melee attack, you will return to your Primary weapon when you aim or fire. If you instead press F while in Melee mode, you will now equip your Secondary weapon.\nFixed a case where you could be left in an UNARMED state after using a non-Melee Exalted weapon (like Hildryn's Balefire) and went back to Melee when you had no other weapons in your loadout, having gone Melee only to that mission.\nFixed the Operator's Vazarin Guardian Shell not manifesting the charged Void Blast shield.\nFixed an issue where auto-blocking could cancel the charged/heavy Melee attacks.\nImplemented fixes toward briefly being unable to Melee after an Aerial Attack, which breaks the flow of battle.\nFixed being able to Quick Melee when you equip an Archgun with either a Primary or Secondary equipped before that.\nFixed the Melee-only Parry becoming a toggle that you can't release until you attack for Clients.\nFixes towards the Wise Razor Stance giving unintended extreme velocity. Comical yes, but clearly an oversight of gravity!\nFixed the Melee combo menu not updating with the proper button inputs to use Melee when using a controller. \nFixed missing Melee Channeling binding callout in the Advanced Melee screen of the Codex when using a controller.\nFixed a number of Melee attacks that could leave weapon trails active after the attack is finished.\nFixed losing your crouch position when initiating a Melee to gun swap while crouching.\nHildryn can use her custom dodge while in Aegis Storm at the cost of her Shields (50). We're starting with this cost because many abilities of this nature have movement restrictions that can be overcome with Augments (Peacemaker, Resonating Quake, Assimilate). We want to try out a movement cost before we tweak further based on feedback. \nRemoved additional sound for Hildryn's Haven ability based on feedback.\nRemoved ability to access Gear/Emote/Hotkeys when Hildryn is in Aegis Storm due to it breaking functionality. \nFixed Clients seeing incorrect animation when observing a Host Hildryn in her Aegis Storm ability.\n1) We have Restored Arcanes not triggering from Exalted weapons across the board by reverting the change made in Update 24.4.0:\nDispatch Overdrive now applies to Garuda’s Talons when equipped.\nBalance is a conversation that we constantly have, and we see you having as well. For some people the answer is don't nerf things, buff everything else. This is the path of least resistance for us, as most of the player base is happy when we buff, and angry when we nerf. However this has a few side effects that impact the game as a whole. First, with more damage, the time to kill on enemies is lowered and the value of Crowd Control declines even more (Vauban?!). Higher max damage also means that players with the latest bells and whistles can easily kill bosses in an instant, and overcome any challenge with ease. The more your play, the easier the game gets!\nSo far we have been kicking the can down the road, accepting power creep and its consequences on the game \nand often this game is a 'kill all the things' based game. We've mostly done nerfs on things that could be automated, required no player interaction or removed options from the game by making all other choices bad. We will continue to wrestle with this, but the most important part is when and if we decide major balance changes are needed, we will let you know and it will be the result of a lot of consideration. Design changes like this need to be more tempered and considered.\nThanks for hanging in there through all this confusion. Six years in and we are still learning how to do this.\nK-Drive Race Standing has been doubled!\nStanding gained per Gate is now 200\nMax Standing gained per Race is now 6000\nCoolant Raknoids now pop their backs on death \ndelicious! \nThe Trading screen now contains a Riven category and specific search functionality!\nRemoved an unintended projectile launch on the 2nd charge attack of the Tatsu. This feature (as many have already determined) is unfinished, and will be revisited in the near future. Possibly tied to a certain Warframe...\nCorpus have improved their vent construction by removing momentum killing edges as reported here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/azz6m4/de_can_we_for_the_love_of_lotus_remove_those_tiny/\nReduced the frequency at which Nora Night’s daily transmissions play.\nWidened a damaged bunker opening in the Kuva Survival tileset.

  "changes": "Buried Debts: Hotfix 24.4.2:\nTenno, thank you kindly for your feedback, videos, and reactions so far on last night's Melee changes! We've been live for less than 24 hour with Phase 1 and we're going to start experimenting a little bit with some feedback. Our first experiment has to do with players who are truly committed to 'The Sword Alone'.\nManual blocking/parry has been added when players wield only a Melee weapon in a mission (i.e NO Secondary or Primary equipped). This is possible because in this specific state, the keybindings are free to allow this manual blocking. We do not plan on adding it to any other state yet. The default keybind for this is RMB/Right Mouse Button (LT for controller), as it was in the past.\nMelee Channeling can no longer be rebound on Controller due to it completely breaking Melee 2.99997 changes. We apologize for the discomfort this may cause for those who have built their controllers comfortably around a different binding. You can't make an omelette without cracking some eggs!\nFixed a widespread issue where players using Controllers could no longer Aim after the Melee 2.99997 changes. This affected numerous mechanics like Aim Gliding, Melee Channeling, etc.\nWe’ll be continuing to monitor controller issues as they arise! If you’re still having issues, restoring your Controller bindings to ‘Default’ will help in the meantime. Please let us know of further issues!\nFixed an issue where attempting to reload your Primary/Secondary while in Melee mode would not transition you back to your gun.\nRemoved Hildryn's Shield-gate mechanic that was applying to Eidolon Lures, resulting in an invulnerability for 3 seconds after their Shields are destroyed before becoming vulnerable again.\nFixes towards Teralyst (and possibly Gantulyst/Hydrolyst) getting stuck in the Plains which caused constant teleporting all over the landscape.\nFixes towards Teralyst (and possibly Gantulyst/Hydrolyst) not using abilities.\nHildryn's Main Blueprint has moved from Vox Solaris' Offering Rank of Shadow (Rank 5) to Agent (Rank 2).\nGreatly reduced the camera angle when casting Hildryn’s Haven.\nFixed Hildryn’s Shield Pillage not removing Status Effects for Clients.\nFixed Hildryn being able to use ziplines (and other context actions) while in Aegis Storm.\nFixed script errors when casting Hildryn’s Balefire.\nImprovements towards the Operator curly hair hairlines to show less scalp.\nBalanced the Jat Kittag spark FX for less visual noise.\nThe Rakta Dark Dagger’s innate upgrade on equip is now called Mind Haze.\n",

Thermia can be found fracturing the surface of the Orb Vallis during thermal flare-ups. Could this be the key to weakening the Exploiter Orb's defenses?\nDiluted Thermia now displays as a special pickup in the UI (similar to Argon Crystal, etc).\nAmalgam Mods can now be Chat linked and found in the Codex.\nFixed a crash when engaging with a Thermia Fracture.\nFixed Coolant Canisters disappearing if you picked them up too quickly.\nHotdropped a fixed early this morning that was preventing players from downloading Warframe from the website. If you experienced this issue please try again!\nFixed real money purchased weapons (Prime Access, etc) not coming potatoed (Orokin Catalyst). Missing potatoes have been rectified to affected accounts in either your Inventory or the respective potatoless weapon depending on if you potatoed after the purchase was made.\nFixed inability to login when playing in Steam Big Picture mode.\nFixed cases of some enemies not attacking in Plains or Orb Vallis.\nFixed a crash that occurred when unzooming or switch weapons during Mining.\nFixed inability to Trade if it includes an Ayatan Star.\nFixed Exard Scaffold not resetting damage resistances on Sentients.\nFixed Harrow’s Penance recast not refreshing Duration.\nFixed Gara’s Splinter Storm self timer not being refreshed when affected by Mass Vitrify.\nFixed the Tarock Thrown Blade Skin not applying to the Spira Prime or Hikou Prime once thrown.\nFixed missing FX/texture for Rhino’s Iron Skin.\nFixed missing Elemental FX for the Glaive Prime.\nFixed Kitgun FX lingering perpetually if the Glaive is also equipped.\nFixed Warframe Ability videos turning white after unfocusing on the Ability.\nWe’re still seeing some playback issues with these that we’re investigating! \nFixed missing functionality when clicking an active Resource Booster in the UI.\nFixed Foundry UI notifications displaying a filepath.\nFixed [PH] context actions in the Mastery Rank 27 test.\nFixed a script error when accessing the Dojo Room Option Panel.\n",

This entire Update is about 2.7 GB, get ready! What follows is a summary of the Operation post!\nThis Operation begins with a Community Goal \nthe hunt is on, Tenno. Can you unlock the secrets of the dead? If you've been paying attention to Devstreams, you may already know where to start looking...\nYou can receive Operation Specific Rewards by participating in parts of this event.\nThe first reward is more abstract \nyou can expand the Orb Vallis by solving a puzzle.... Together.\nThermia fractures are cracking open the surface of Venus, a consequence of Nef Anyo’s unrelenting greed. He’s willing to do whatever it takes for a quick profit, including putting the whole Orb Vallis at risk. By figuring out how to stop the Thermia fractures, you're able to earn these rewards:\nOperation Emblem\nAmalgam Mods x4\nOperation Sigil\nOpticor Vandal\nYou get 1 point for each Thermia Fracture you close \nif you close 4 Fractures with 1 Coolant canister, you get 3 bonus points (7 total)!\nAnd eventually, an incredible new boss fight will unlock where you can earn Hildryn! We are expecting this to take approximately a week with the estimated pacing of this Operation. Free players \nwe appreciate your patience, rest assured Hildryn is a completely free Warframe for you to earn as the Operation unfolds!\nGood luck, Tenno. You can all help each other if you know where to look.\n\n\n\n\nHildryn can be obtained via the Market, Little Duck Offering (Main BP), and as drops from a new Boss fight.\n\nHildryn Asuron Helmet can be acquired in the Market and in Nightwave’s next Series Offerings.\nSurator Syandana can be acquired in the Market.\nLarkspur can be acquired in the Market and in the Tenno Lab Clan Research.\nHildryn Collection can be acquired in the Market.\n\n\nQuaro Syandana can be acquired in the Market.\n\nLimbo Limina Collection can be acquired in the Market.\n\nTatsu can be acquired in the Market.\n\n\nTenno \nyour favorite melee weapon probably feels a little different today. Today we bring you Phase 1 of 2019’s melee upgrade \nwe hope you love all the gorgeous new visual effects, streamlined combat, and high fidelity hit reactions! Here's what you can expect:\nNo one knows the power of their Arsenal better than the Tenno \nyour adaptability and skill with the blade will be tested, and as we continue these changes, we rely on your feedback!\nIf you missed the full workshop discussing Phase 1, you can catch it here:\n\n\n\nGlaive slam range increased to 5m\nWarfan slam range increased to 5m\nDagger slam range increased to 5m\nDual dagger slam range increased to 6m\nClaw weapon slam range increased to 6m\nGunblade slam range increased to 5m\nNunchaku slam range increased to 6m\nSword and Shield slam range increased to 7m\nSingle Sword slam range increased to 7m\nBlade Whip slam range increased to 7m\nRapier slams increased to 6m\nDual Sword slam range increased to 8m\nTonfa slam range increased to 8m\nMachete slam range increased to 7m\nNikana slam range increased to 6m\nHammer slam range increased to 9m\nStaff slam range increased to 6m\nPolearm slam range adjusted to 7m\nScythe slam range increased to 8m\nHeavy Blade slam range increased to 8m\nFists weapon slam range increased to 8m\nSparring weapon slam range increased to 7m\nA full Visual FX pass has been done for Phase 1! Because this is Phase 1, it 'means all the unique weapons will have new generic FX for a little while (Jat Kittag etc.) until we can get through them all and make new clean variants'.\nNew and cleaner FX have been created with the idea of beautifully short, highly detailed lifespans. Not infinite \nmeaning the 'Constant Weapon Trail' option will be removed as a result of this change (at least for Phase 1, we really do think it looks better removed).\nBLOCKING\nBlocking with a melee weapon is no longer keybound, it is automatic when facing enemies who are dealing damage to you in melee mode. Your Reticle determines all!\nCHANNELING\nChanneling is now a toggle set to your alt-fire button when in melee mode.\nYour 'F' button (if using default key bindings) now exclusively swaps between Primary and Secondary weapons with a tap.\nYour left mouse button is gun fire, always, instantly.\nYour right mouse button is now aim, always, instantly.\nOPTIONS:\nWe are adding a toggle to preserve one aspect of the older melee system. You will be able to toggle an option, allowing you to continue melee attacks with the left mouse button once in melee mode.\nUpdated Reticles: Melee mode has received its own reticle!\nArchwing: Arch-Melee & Archgun now also use the 'instant swap' behaviour.\nDual Wield (i.e Glaive & Single Secondary) is still supported!\nExalted weapons will also benefit from the uninterrupted swaps! Be aware that Energy will still drain, even when swapping between weapons!\nAI hit reacts are getting updated! Enemies will have a more visceral/realistic response to the various hits you dish out.\nWith Melee Blocking now automatic, the Blocking angle has been reduced to 45 degrees.\nSigma & Octantis and Cobra & Crane Shield throw animations have been shortened and speed increased. \nIf using no custom Energy color, the weapon will inherit the colors of the Elemental FX (or base trails if no elements are present). This unifies all colors (swing FX, trails, hit FX, etc).\nRakta Dark Dagger’s equipped bonus is now an innate upgrade that triggers on equip and lasts for 30 secs (refreshed on Melee equip).\nVaykor Sydon’s Radial Blind now triggers upon toggling Melee Channel on/off if you have the required charges stored.\n\n\nIntroducing a new way to customize your Warframe: Ephemera! These new 'ATTACHMENTS' can only be earned and crafted by the brave. Once you acquire an Ephemera Blueprint and craft it, the ability to equip an Ephemera will appear in your Arsenal under Attachments!\nSeeding Step Ephemera (obtained from Arbitrations)\nFreezing Step Ephemera (obtained from New Boss Fight)\nShocking Step Ephemera (obtained from New Boss Fight)\nBlazing Step Ephemera (obtained from Elite Sanctuary Onslaught)\nBleeding Body Ephemera (obtained from Arbitration Honors)\nSmoking Body Ephemera (obtained from Stalker)\n\n3 new curly haired Operator Hairstyles are now available! Choose from Curly Bun, Curly Braid, or Curly Ponytail.\nIn addition, Operator hairline has been improved to show less scalp. The Tenno have improved their hair care routine and it shows!\n\n\nCorpus inspired Highbrow, Two-Sloops, and Thugs Blueprints are available from Roky! Lord a tha board!\nBounties are now available out in the Plains of Eidolon! Certain tents placed throughout the Plains contain a console that encompasses the power to contact Konzu himself (when he’s not on his early lunch). \nWith Bounties now available out in the Plains, Incursions have been removed. These were meant to give players something optional to do as they spend their time in the Plains, but since Bounties can be activated on command, they no longer serve a purpose.\nPolished numerous Junction boss fights to have better power usage and combat pacing. \nRewrote Melee section of the “Training: Basics” Codex entry. \nRewrote Melee 2.0 section and renamed to “Advanced Melee” and moved to be beside \"Advanced Movement\".\nRemoved \"Dark Sectors\" section from the Training Codex.\nThe Warframe Abilities screen has received a visual and functional overhaul! \nAbility information is now displayed in a more condensed form, with hover-over functionality to display specific Stats and expand the information. \nA new ‘Tips’ section can be hover-overed to display tips for that respective Warframe’s Abilities such as tricks to synergize with other Warframes, most effective Damage output methods, Ability interactions within the Warframe it self, and more!\nRespective Ability videos now also appear upon hover-over to add that little extra spice! This initial Ability video aspect is currently functional for Excalibur, Mag, Volt, Garuda, Baruuk, Revenant, and Hildryn! More to gradually come!\nYour chosen UI Theme is now thematically reflected.\nThe Arcane Manager has received a visual overhaul to match the chosen UI Theme! Along with the new visual appeal, the Manager now also:\nLists which Arcanes you do not own (hovering over will display information)\nArcane Ranks displayed on the right-side are now selectable, allowing for a more direct Rank Up mechanic.\nThe Dojo Trading screen has received an overhaul!\n6 Trading Slots instead of 5! \nFaster item selection responsiveness and improved UI to help you easily find the items you want to Trade.\nRespective Warframe Ability stats can now be seen in the Warframe Arsenal Upgrade screen.\nThe Dojo Decoration screen and Dojo Room Construction screen now reflects your chosen UI Theme!\nHUD Damage Numbers and Affinity Numbers can now be separately toggled in the Interface Settings! \nRight clicking an Arcane in the Mod Upgrade screen now unequips it, similar to Mods.\nIf Coupons, Boosters, 2x Events, etc are active, hovering over the Icon in the top right will display a list of the respective active events.\nNumerous widespread changes to capitalized vs lowercase UI text.\nAdjusted the size and positioning of the generic notification popup.\nRemoved “.” period characters from names of Weapons and Pets.\nUpdated all mentions of Solar Map/Solar Chart to Star Chart.\nAdded checkmark to the ‘Ready to Trade’ UI screen.  \nImproved successful Mining discrepancies where it would appear you hit the perfect sweet spot in the heat gauge but were told otherwise.\nFixed stats when previewing Amp Parts while the Preview Gilded option is toggled appearing as Ungilded > Gilded. Now, it compares Gilded > Gilded with the new Amp Part.\nFixed UI lock after selecting ‘Replicate’ and then closing the Research screen in the Dojo.\nFixed certain Warframe Passive descriptions in the purchase screen and info popup not showing proper values.\nFixed UI breaking when sending someone a Gift and then traveling to Fortuna.\nFixed some UI Themes not maintaining respective text color.\nFixed Gear Spiral items displaying darker than expected when viewed in the Arsenal.\nFixed the Mining UI will disappear if killed while Mining.\nFixed Valkyr’s Warcry UI not reflecting the Eternal War Mods timer increase.\nIn Update 24.2, we included a number of changes to increase controller responsiveness. The initial changes caused the slightest changes in trigger pressure to interrupt firing and ADS \nwhich is being experienced predominantly with continuous fire weapons such as fully automatic and beam weapons (including Mining tools). This is due to a far too small trigger release threshold between firing and not firing.\nThis is, however, very effective with pistol weapons where a limited threshold allows for quick trigger taps.\nWith that said, this update is bringing the following changes to address the above:\nWe have increased the trigger release sensitivity so that there is more space for error between firing and release. This will help curb the muscle fatigue experienced with having to maintain constant pressure on the triggers as well as alleviate the accidental breaks in firing and aiming. This will require a bit more pressure to be released on the triggers before you will stop aiming and firing.\nWe increased trigger release sensitivity but maintained press sensitivity to strike balance between quick tap and continuous fire weapons. In other words, we have maintained the firing ease of Pistol weapons with quick trigger taps but have increased the freedom to apply various levels of pressure with continuous fire weapons.\nWhile this has felt much better overall in testing, we know that some may find that the increase still constraints gameplay in some form. More importantly, Tenno with disabilities may also find that this limits their ability to play. So we have also added 2 new sliders in Options > Controls to adjust trigger sensitivity to your liking:\n\nThe sliders will allow you to tailor exactly how much pressure you feel is most comfortable/close to your preference of play.\nThe homing energy projectiles that Enthrall pillars emit now have a chance to Enthrall enemies while inflicting damage if there is room in the Enthrall cap. This allows Enthrall to spread more organically, and as the cap is reached, damage continues on other targets. \nFixed Revenant becoming stuck in his spinning animations if he becomes downed during Danse Macabre. \nFixed Mesmer Skin consuming multiple charges when getting hit multiple times in the same frame from the same enemy (e.g. a projectile that hits you and explodes).\nLowered the Standing cost of the Tulok and Param Fishing Spears to 500 and made them available at Rank 0.\nImproved the visibility of the Color Pigment Research in the Clan Log by adding further detailed information as well as color coded texted to each respective Pigment.\nAssassinate encounters are no longer global, they are now localized to a specific area within a radius. \nThe encounter can be abandoned by leaving the radius.\nWe made this change because we received feedback that players are getting frustrated that they are so widely separated when trying to achieve the same goal in Bounties. \nChanged bonus objective of the Corpus Assassinate Bounty on Vallis: the Bounty will now fail if enough Credits are not gathered before the timer runs out, and Tenno will earn a bonus for collecting enough Credits within a shorter amount of time. This Bounty didn’t have a failstate like others, so we tweaked the objective and bonus objective for consistency. \nThe timer now scales based on how many players are in the squad. \nThe less players there are the more time is granted to complete.  \nAssassinate target now scales based on how many players are in the squad. \nChanged the cover evaluator for the Assassination targets in Orb Vallis Bounties so that they don’t run as far to find cover.\n\nOnce the 'mission complete' interval is met, players can head to extraction any time they choose (i.e 5 minutes for Survival). \nAny player at extraction triggers a countdown timer. \nIf all players leave the extraction zone, the countdown timer is cancelled.\nWhen the timer is up, the extraction ship arrives and any players in the extraction zone leave.\nAnyone still playing can extract later any time they choose.\nWe have made some much requested changes to the responsiveness of two things in Warframe: Weapon swapping and automatic doors. Right now in Warframe, if you are connected as a client you may have experienced delays in responsiveness of either of these essential things! The changes should result in a much smoother experience:\nSwapping weapons as a Client will now feel more responsive because we've made it Client-Authoritative.\nAutomatic Doors have been made Client-Authoritative. Previously there were cases of door not opening in tandem with the Host if any latency was experienced\nCameras now have a number indication to help differentiate them when viewing a large number of cameras together in one scene.\nVisualized cameras can now be selected by gazing at them in Free Cam Mode. \nEnabled pressing X to play the camera in Captura.\nMinor fixes for camera animation and post process lingering after Free Cam Mode is exited.\nFixed the Flox Syandana not unfolding its wings in the Arsenal and Captura.\nThe Navigation Window (where Alerts used to propagate) now displays more information about current activities such as the Plains Time of Day, Orb Vallis Temperature, Nightwave Acts, and more!\nOperator Void Dash no longer 'collides' with enemies if you didn't actually move with your Void Dash.\nCorinth Mastery Rank requirement reduced to 8 from 10.\nThe Chesa Kubrow Retrieve Precept has been changed to reflect the following mechanic:\nChesa Kubrow now attempts to retrieve the single closest loot, the same way Nekros’ Desecrate does.\nK-Drive races now award Affinity towards the actually K-Drive, not just Ventkid Standing!\nRemoved Synthula from Rotation A (Survival, Defense, Interception) rewards and made into a Clan Research Blueprint. \nIncreased Stim buff duration to NPC’s from 30 seconds to 120. \nChanged Burston building requirements to 600 Ferrite instead of 600 Nano Spores.\nExodia Contagion now requires you to be Aim Gliding to launch the Infested energy projectile.\nCleaned up grenade sounds across all enemies \nCorpus and Grineer now have unique grenade warning beeps and explosions!\nMagus Revert now has a 3 second cooldown. This cooldown is a result of macro abuse in conjunction with Magus Lockdown and Madurai Meteoric Dash in order to deal an absurd amount of damage all at once. This change also fixes the issue:\nFixed ability to Void Dash contentiously for no Energy cost when Magus Lockdown, Magus Revert, and Madurai Meteoric Dash are triggered.\nReflex Guard Mod has changed from 55% Auto Parry Chance to +100% Parry Angle.\nRenamed Limbo’s Haven Augment Mod to Rift Haven.\nImproved hand placement in the kneeling animation when logging into Warframe where chonkier Warframes appeared to have their hands clipping through their legs.\nSmall tweak towards the Corpus Sapping Osprey mine area-of-effect to better convey the hazardous radius.\nTweaked Corpus Ospreys movement to have more bodily rotation. \nNova’s Neutron Star Augment has been updated to reflect the following mechanic change:\nNull Stars (on recast) are shot to enemies within 30 meters (closer enemies prioritized), on contact they explode for the same area-of-effect they do today. If it can't find any enemies they explode like they do now.\nTweaked Vallis Terra enemy lasers to be thinner/fade near the end, and to be more freezing/snow looking versus electric.\nUpdated the firing FX of the Opticor.\nOptimizations for multi-core processing that were not possible with Windows XP.\nOptimized Orb Vallis level visibility and zoning.\nOptimized certain effects when hidden (such as the Edo Prime shoulder plate channelling electricity).\nMade some micro-optimizations to UI performance in Orbiter and on Pause screens.\nMade a micro-optimization to texture prioritization.\nMade some micro-optimizations to rendering.\nMade some micro-optimizations to GPU particles.\nMade numerous micro-optimizations to memory management.\nChanged Limbo’s Stasis to no longer affect temporarily friendly enemies (Nyx’s Mind Control, Revenant’s Enthrall). \nPolished the Exergis reload animation for smoothness.  \nIncreased the radius of the Profit-Takers final explosion \nyou betta run!\nAll Orbs in the Orb Vallis are now immune to the effects of Corrosive Projection.\nIf Alad V is killed before his taunt transmissions finish, the transmissions will now be cut off by his death cry.\nRe-enabled ability to equip multiple Echo-Lures to the Gear Wheel. This allows for quicker access to desired Echo-Lure when in that heated Conservation moment!\nShockwaves caused by Heavy Impact or Rhino’s Passive now use your Energy colour.\nChanged Garuda’s FX to green ooze and other particles for Tenno with Gore disabled.\nImproved the Corpus Dropship explosions on Vallis for an added razzle dazzle. \nIncreased the distance at which you can see Dropships warping in/out on the Plains of Eidolon. \nReduced volume of Archgun load and reload sounds.\nMelee combo damage multiplier now affects Baruuk Desert Wind waves.\nImproved mesh details on the Operator chair.\nUpdated Jackal's materials to PBR.\nImproved the camera shake on Baruuk’s Serene Storm ability.\nOptimized Landscape level visibility and zoning of Orb Vallis minimap. \nMade some micro-optimizations to the launcher's cache verification tools. \nMade a micro-optimization to memory garbage collection performance.\nMade some improvements to what Mods are prioritized when using auto install. \nImproved performance for Oberon’s Hallowed Eruption Augment.\nImproved performance for the enemy MOA leap ability in Orb Vallis. \nRemoved [PH] from Codex descriptions of Raknoid and Orb enemies.\nImproved sky fog in the Grineer Sealab tileset.\nImproved lighting & certain ramp sizes in the Grineer Sealab tileset.\nImproved environmental AI on the Grineer Sealab tileset. \nImprovements towards AI pathing in the Grineer Asteroid Defection tileset. \nWhen Titania is in Razorwing, melee strikes on the butterflies no longer cause screen shake. \nImproved Shield Lancer strafing movement. \nImproved AI jump actions in the Grineer Forest Defense tileset to alleviate getting stuck on their path to the Defense Target reported here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/auy1a2/the_enemies_ai_path_at_lith_defence_on_earth_is/\nTweaks to the Leech Osprey projectile mesh to fix it floating when stuck to the player.\nLowered Health of Grineer Arc Traps so they can be easily destroyed by a Melee radial slam.\nDispatch Overdrive now applies to Garuda’s Talons when equipped.\n",

The Archweapon Deployer can be obtained by completing the Orb Heist Phase 3 Bounty.\nAtmosphere Arch-Guns consume Ammo as opposed to unlimited Ammo/Battery in Archwing. Specifically new Heavy Ammo Drops which can be found from Corpus enemies in Orb Heist missions. Heavy Ammo Drops also reset the 10 minute cool-down when picked up, or replenish Ammo if needed.\nAtmosphere Arch-Gun can be summoned in normal missions with the Archweapon Deployer, but once Ammo has been depleted there is a 10 minute cool-down until you can summon again.

Since her revisited kit depends on enemies effectively hitting each other, we changed the passive to make Nyx simply harder to hit.\nMind Control has a 4 second wind up at the start where incoming damage will cause the target's damage output to increase. The stronger your weaponry, the deadlier the output of your victim! \nReminder: All damage inflicted to the target will apply once Nyx deactivates Mind Control, or when the Duration runs out. \nBetter 'follow Nyx and attack enemies' AI pass.\nMind Control can now be cast while moving, and no longer halts Nyx in her tracks!\nThe cast time for Mind Control has been decreased, so you can better use the 4-second window to ‘power up’ your new minion!\nNyx’s passive ability to make enemies miss will be deactivated when she is using Absorb, meaning no shot will be wasted!\nNo longer deals any damage and will temporarily disable Armor & Shield, slow down Infested units, and disable Ancients' Auras.\nPsychic Bolts can be cast once on up to 6 targets. Kill these targets before you can cast again, OR hold '2' to reset targets and cast again!\nAbsorb damage type is now based on the damage types it absorbs.\nBaseline Energy Capacity increased to hit 225 at Max Rank.\nLantern can be cast up to 4 times at once (new targets replace old). Targets will gradually float back to their starting positions. You will be able to 'explode' all targets by holding the Lantern cast.\nRazorwing has a 'Vacuum' built in!\nVenus Shield Ospreys the spawn Nullifier bubbles only spawn if the Orb Vallis Alert level is 3+ and if the enemy level is 20+. \nLevel 2+ Alert level will spawn Shield Ospreys that don’t spawn Nullifier bubbles. \nA max of 2 Nullifier bubbles can be created per Drone.\nTotal active Nullifier bubbles (from all Drones) in the area will not exceed 4 \n10 bubbles (scaling with player count).\nQuick fire area-of-effect returned to 2m as intended.\nCharged fire projectile speed increased.\nMag size increased from 45 to 48.\nAmmo capacity increased from 270 to 288.\nClip size no longer affects charge time and is now set at 1 sec.\nCharged fire now deals self damage.\nReduced the shockwave distortion FX.\nChanged from semi auto to automatic.\nAdded a small amount of recoil for feedback when firing.\nnow has proper accuracy stats so mods will effect it\nFirestorm and Terminal Velocity Mods can now be equipped.\nReduced Aim Zoom from 2.23 to 1.6x.\nDamage-over-Time damage is now affected by +damage mods\nUpdated the overall FX.\nFire Rate increased from 2 to 3.\nAmmo capacity increased from 60 to 72.\nClip size decreased from 10 to 8.\nFire Rate increased from 2.67 to 3.33.\nAmmo capacity increased from  75 to 96.\nClip size increased from 15 to 16.\nCritical Chance increased from 5% to 14%.\nIncreased lock on angle of sticky beams from 15-30 to 40-60 (first number is angle it can obtain a lock, second number is when beam will lose it’s lock).\nIncreased Mag size from 40 to 60.\nIncreased Ammo capacity from 200 to 300.\nReduced the delay until you can use primary fire after using it's secondary fire.\nReduced aimed recoil.\nIncreased the recharge rate of Pax Charge when used with all Chambers apart from Catchmoon.\nPax Soar now also reduces the effect of gravity when firing a Kitgun.\nPax Bolt chance to activate increased from 50% to 100% at max rank.\nSplat Loader reload speed increased from 1.9 to 1.7 secs when used with Gaze Chamber.\nKillstream Loader status chance increased from 11 to 13% when used with Catchmoon Chamber.\nTombfinger Chamber area-of-effect damage origin now matches point of impact instead of behind it.\nOne major issue address is the fixing of an issue where almost 50% controller input was required before a hip-fire camera manipulation could be executed. We’ve decreased coded deadzones to allow for more refined, precise aiming and removed the inherited velocity when shifting directions. Players should now notice an immediate falloff in camera movement once input is no longer applied to the control sticks.\nAdditionally, we have added a number of mathematical improvements regarding the ramp and acceleration curves used to interpolate control stick input. This should make the camera manipulations feel much smoother and allow for a closer approximation of circular movement, compared to the very ‘square’ like motions we had previously.\nWe’ve also increased the amount of vertical movement seen when manipulating the control stick to reduce the amount of asymmetry between it and horizontal movement. There is still a bias towards the horizontal plane, but moving the camera up/down should not feel so drastically different when now compared to left/right movement.\nFixed Void Mode being toggled/stuck on sometimes due to interaction with the Power Menu on controllers.\nAnimal Pheromone Synthesizer items have been added to The Business’ Offerings! When deployed before using an Echo-Lure, these increase the chance of attracting a Rare variant of the respective animal. \nIncreased range of Tranq Rifle pulsing sound from 100m to 180m. \nFixed the UI breaking and Echo-Lure/Tranq/Mining Lasers not functioning after dismounting a K-Drive.\nFixed having no weapon when getting downed while the Echo-Lure or Tranq is equipped.\nFixed Tranqing an animal during its despawn animation would cause instant disappearance.\nFixed Echo-Lure’s not changing pitch for Clients.\nFixed a case of the Echo-Lure UI indicator not matching true pitch of the animal call.\nFixed Conservation UI (and other custom scopes) being disabled when dismounting a K-Drive.\nFixed potential cases of the Conservation start point or the call point spawning too far into the edge of the map, making it unreachable.\nFixed inability to use Warframe abilities after mounting a K-Drive with a Fishing Spear equipped.\nFixed rare case of Orb Vallis Servofish repeatable getting stuck in a specific spot.\nFixed Servofish frequently being worth 0.0 points.\nThe initial Trading Post screen and Research screen in the Dojo have been reworked to not only be more functional and aesthetically pleasing, but also to match your chosen UI Theme! \nResearch in progress now displays contribution progress in the right panel and incomplete material contributions will appear faded.\nHovering over non-Credit Research requirement materials now shows the item info as well as the amount owned.\nChanges:\nRemoved ‘-50% Magazine Capacity’ from the Precision Munitions Mod in Conclave.\n",

It includes Zaws, K-Drive, Kitguns, Moa and Amp parts.\nThe Ambush Coildrive is now invincible from the start to prevent griefing or accidental kills.

We dedicate it to you.\nStay warm on your K-Drives, Tenno!\nThe Orb Vallis landscape is so vast in size and discovery that even with the following 20+ pages of notes, this is just the first installment of Fortuna content! You can expect more to come in the next couple of weeks, including more Conservation species, new Operator Amps that will be available for sale from Little Duck’s offerings, and your chance to take down the ultimate threat roaming these terraformed lands. The long awaited Melee 3.0 will also be making its debut in full to accompany the Melee sound additions and changes that were released in Update 23.10.0. A Dev Workshop on the changes will be posted in the future.\nAs you take your first steps into Fortuna, meet with the Solaris and await the Corpus threats that linger above at the surface, the devs will be preparing to launch the second part of the Fortuna update.\nCompleting the Vox Solaris Quest will unlock the following Vendors in Fortuna:\nEudico \nBounties\nThe Business\nFishing & Conservation\nLegs \nMoa Companions\nVox Solaris \nRaknoid Hunting & Operator Agent\nRoky & Boon \nVentkids & K-Drives\nAxiditre \nNoctrul \nPhasmin\nTravoride \nGoblite\nVenerol\nHesperon \nAmarast\nZodian\nThyst\nSmokefinger also offers many other services such as purchasing Gems for Platinum, trading Gems for Solaris United Standing, and a lustrous list of Offerings available for purchase using Solaris United Standing:\n\nA new take on the Plains of Eidolon Fishing Mechanic!\nThe best way to catch the robotic 'Servofish' in The Orb Vallis is with The Business' offering of PULSE SPEARS \ntools used to disable mechanical fish! This new type of fishing spear maintains the high quality of every Servofish you catch.\nThe Business offers 2 variants of Pulse Spears:\n\n\nYour Ostron Spears will still work in The Orb Vallis, but the fish will be damaged. The key is to catch undamaged fish with the specialized Pulse Spears.\nThere are 13 species of Servofish to be discovered in the various Coolant areas of the Orb Vallis. Some require Baits \nbe sure to read descriptions to find your very own:\n\nEye-Eye\nScrubbers\nEchowinders\nMirewinders\nLongwinders\nSapcaddy\nBrickie\nTink\nKriller\nRecaster\nCharamote\nTromyzon\nSynathid\nBaits are used to attract certain species of Servofish.

Good luck catching them all!\n\nWhy Conserve?\nIn addition to rewarding Standing for each catch, you get treasured items for your efforts. Each animal you successfully conserve will yield you a Tag that can be exchanged for a treasured reminder of your efforts to help the wildlife. From 'Floofs' to a badge, find the offerings from The Business!\nThese Corpus-tech Modular Secondaries are crafted using a Chamber, Grip, and Loader. Blueprints for these components are purchased from Zuud using Solaris United Standing.

Once you have a Model, Core, Gyro, and Brackets, you can assemble your Moa:\nLegs also offers new Robotics weapons that can be used by both Moas and Sentinels:\nCryotra: Emits a ray of sub-zero energy.\nTazicor: Burst rifle that fires electrified rounds.\nVulcax: Charges up a powerful blast of ultra-heated plasma.\nThe Emotion Module determines a Moa’s audio set and physical reactions to its environment. You can purchase an Emotion Module from the Market and equip it on your Moa the same way you equip Animation Sets on Warframes! Choose between Aggressive, Inquisitive, and Sensitive. Feel free to switch it up any time!\nLegs can Gild any Max Rank Moa to enhance its stats! Your Moa will also reward Mastery Experience once it has been Gilded.\nThe Moa head is the component that rewards Mastery Rank, because the head determines the Model.

Note that you will need to complete The Second Dream quest before you can be initiated into Vox Solaris.\nNeutral\nOperative\nUse your Standing to purchase the newest classes of Mechanical Operator Armour:\nHowzit, glinty? If you’re looking for a new way to traverse the Orb Vallis, the Ventkids have you covered. Hangin’ with their logical fam in the ducts of Fortuna, the Ventkids get by stealing parts from the Corpus and running K-Drive races out on the Vallis.\nGLINTY \nWHOZIT \nPROPER FELON \nPRIMO \nLOGICAL\nA member of the Vent Pobbers gang, Roky is your go-to for all things K-Drives. You can exchange Ventkids Standing with her for K-Drive component blueprints, and she will even bash together a plank for you if you ask nicely.\nThese components do not offer any stat bonuses, but the Board will earn you Mastery when you rank up your K-Drive -\nno Gilding required! You can earn Affinity for your K-Drive by completing tricks in the Vallis.\nFor additional statistic or functionality boosts, Roky also offers a variety of Mods (in exchange for Ventkids Standing) for you to equip on your K-Drive in the Arsenal. Much like your Archwing, K-Drives can be customized in the new combined “Vehicles” (previously “Archwing”) mode in your Arsenal.\n\n*You can view final Mod stats by visiting Roky in the Clubhouse in Fortuna!\nChange the colors and choose your K-Drive Scrawl, featuring art from the Ventkids themselves, in the Customize menu. K-Drive Scrawls can be resized and re-oriented similar to Sigils, and can be found in bundles in the Market for Platinum!\nKubrodons Series 1 Scrawl\nKubrodons Series 2 Scrawl\nPobbers Series 1 Scrawl\nPobbers Series 2 Scrawl\nWhile you’re grinding your way through Orb Vallis, keep an eye out for Boon, the leader of the Kubrodon Ventkid Gang, who wants to see if your K-Drive skills are up to snuff. Look for Ventkids Icons on your minimap in the Vallis to find various K-Drive Race courses littered throughout the landscape.\nTalk to Boon at any of the icons to start a race. The rules are simple: pass through each of the checkpoints within the allotted time to complete the course. The real challenge is showing your K-Drive flair. The more tricks you complete during your race, the higher your overall Leaderboard Score and the more Standing you earn!\nFive K-Drive race courses will be available each day, but you can replay each race for additional Standing until you meet the Standing cap. For those looking for more passive Standing gain, you will earn extra Ventkids Standing for any tricks you complete in the Vallis upon returning to Fortuna.\nKeep an eye out for floating purple K-Drive Trick Boosters that appear while riding out on the Vallis: hit them for an instant boost to your trick score multiplier!\nAim + Direction + Jump = Small (tap) / Big (held) flip in that direction.\nAim + Direction + X  = Directional Dismounts.\nAim + Direction + Jump + Fire = Grab Flip in that direction\nAim + Direction + Crouch + Fire = Grab Grind\nCrouch + Direction + Jump = Air Spins\nYou can also grind on a variety of surfaces in Orb Vallis!\nOther commands:\nSprint is the boost key, to help you gain speed.\nJump can be tapped for a regular jump, or held to charge into a large jump to gain lots of air!\nThis is only a basic overview of the various K-Drive commands -\nbe sure to give them a whirl yourself to see what crazy combinations you can come up with.\n\nThe time cycle between these Temperatures is much shorter than the Day/Night equivalent on the Plains of Eidolon:\nWarm \napproximately 4 minutes\nCold \napproximately 22 minutes\n\nThe Corpus have also settled into this biodome and littered their own tech resources across the land to be discovered.\nMytocardia Spore\nGorgaricus Spore\nTepa Nodule\nThermal Sludge\n...and more!\nTo increase the Alert Level, simply allow the Corpus to summon more with active  'REINFORCEMENT BEACONS'!\nTo decrease it, destroy all REINFORCEMENT BEACONS and hide away out of combat.\nAs Garuda nears death, her damage increases.\nGaruda can be acquired via Orb Vallis Bounties & the Vox Solaris Quest, or in the Market for Platinum.\nFind the Bloodshed Sigil in the Market as part of the Garuda Bundle. You will be able to earn it free in a future Fortuna release \nevent style.\nFind the Nagantaka Blueprint in the Market.\n*Research for the Kreska, Ocucor, and Battacor can be found in the Dojo Energy Lab, or in the Market for Platinum.\n*final stats available in-game\nIn an effort to reduce the inventory duplication clutter that came with the individual Sentinel attack Precept Mods, Wyrm, Wyrm Prime, Carrier, Carrier Prime, Dethcube, Taxon, and the newest Oxylus now come with the “Assault Mode” Mod: “Sentinel will attack first visible enemy within an area” (*final stats available in game).\nIf you already own the original attack Mods they will remain in your inventory but cannot be equipped with Assault Mode. \nAssault Mode has replaced the original attack Mods on enemy drop tables. \nWe increased damage falloff range on the Sweeper Mod by 5m to allow it to work effectively with the Assault Mode Mod.\nPlease read our Developer Workshop for more information and direct your feedback/comments:\n\nSentinel weapon Rivens have been removed from the Riven generation pool. Those who own Sentinel weapon Rivens will still have them in their Inventories. Obtaining a Sentinel weapon Riven was simply lackluster compared to more applicable weapons.\nMining launched with Update 22: Plains of Eidolon and introduced a new resource extracting system to Warframe! Collecting Ore and Gems required you trace a pattern around a deposit using a Mining cutter tool in order to release it from its encasement. Since then it has seen several small iterations over time in order to ease what was at times tricky to execute, especially since the quality of the deposit was affected by the accuracy of the trace (which typically made the process very slow).\nWith the introduction of a brand new open landscape with deposits of its own, we knew that we needed to add new challenge that required similar levels of precision and skill, but in a speedier fashion and with much more return. So with that said, we have made the following changes to Mining:\nA thermometer gauge ring will appear with boxed indicators that denote where you have to land in order to extract from the deposit. Simply hold the fire button and release when you are inside any of the indicators on the ring. Red deposits still indicate Ores and Blue indicates Gems. Landing in the smaller of the indicators yields Gems (even on a Red deposit).\n\n\n\nAll hot spots must be completed in order to successfully collect Ore/Gems. \nHeat spots will glow red to indicate when you have successfully completed it.\nThe more heat spots, the harder the extractions become with timing pressures and moving boxes.  \nIf all of the indicators are missed, you will still be rewarded a small amount of Ore/Gem (depending on the deposit type).\nWe're back again with Operator Suit Changes! You may recall changes introduced in Update 23.10.0 shifted the mesh in several different pieces, including parts of the hood now being attached to the Torso. We did this because mixing and matching pieces is becoming the norm, and we want all Operator cosmetics to be compatible with this. However, the first pass lacked polish.\nChanges are now being implemented so that the hood mesh is no longer attached to the Chest piece of the Operator.\n\nThe Operator Waistband section now displays each Suit’s waist attachments with the proper highlighted cloth displaying in the Icon. For example, prior to this update, the ‘Vahd Greaves’ were missing the center flap cloth due to not having a waistband attachment \nwhich is now fixed!\nThis should be a much smoother roll-out of our mix n match changes.\nEnjoy, Tenno!\nNote from [DE]Megan: I’m personally an Arca Plasmor devotee, and after testing comparisons, it truly remains a radiated plasma punch to the face.\nBounty boards aesthetically changed across the board (Cetus).  Hover to view, right click to expand reward list.\nIncreased the Archwing max height in the Plains of Eidolon to 300 meters.\nThe following Dojo rooms have received a quantity cap (Clans that currently exceed the cap will keep them):\nThe Inspiration Hall now has a max quantity of 3\nThe Custom Obstacle Course now has a max quantity of 5\nEnemy names in the Dojo Color Research screen that weren't all caps are now all caps.\nImproved logic for ordering enemies to move to a NPC Defense Target.\nImprovements towards AI running into walls and Defense Targets getting teleporting into the abyss below in the Grineer Shipyard Defense tilesets.\nThe Gear Spiral now displays RMB instead of TAB to switch to the Emote wheel.\nImproved Nekros’ Shadow of the Dead FX to better support replicating larger AI.\nThe ‘SENTINEL’ Inventory category has been renamed to ‘ROBOTICS’ to welcome the new MOA Companions. \nNumerous Bells, Lanterns, and Nature Decorations in the Dojo have received the PBR treatment! \nImproved lighting and numerous textures in the New Loka Relay room.\nThe Hystrix’s Alt Fire stats have been split into tabs when viewed in the Inventory, to fix the stat information running off the screen.\n",

The team has two plans in place to get your Operator fashion frame back into shape as quickly as possible: a revert and a more careful re-release.. This revert itself is also very involved due to the large quantity of content that was changed, so this will take a bit more time. Worry not, they’re dedicated to restore and elevate Operator Fashion Frame to its glory \nwe thank you for your patience! A more careful re-release that better respects seams and existing looks will come!",

  "changes": "Removed “Defeat 3 Eximus enemies on EARTH” requirement from Venus Junction.\nLowered “Defeat 10 Eximus enemies on Venus” requirement on Mercury Junction to 5 Eximus enemies in any region.\nLowered “Defeat 10 Sentient enemies on Lua” requirement to 5 Sentient enemies.\nLowered “Collect any 3 Mods from the Orokin Principle challenge rooms on Lua” to 1 Mod.\n\nThe much discussed changes have arrived \nthey are quite straight forward, but if you want to really dive deep into them please start with our Dev Workshops for history!\nPart 1/2:\n\n\nOn the major Milestone days (every 50 days between 0-1000) you will be presented with up to 3 Choices! These choices will still respect the original chronological release, and by the next time you reach a given category, you'll see a new item appear in place of what you've already chosen (if applicable).\n1. Sigils and Resources. Days 50,150,250, etc.\n2. Primed Mods. Days 200,400,600, etc.\n3. Weapons. Days 100,300,500, etc.\nDay 1000 and beyond!\nStarting at Day 1050, Evergreen reward choices will be rotated every 50 Days though the following options:\nEvergreen Choices A (choose one):\n3 x Forma\n3 x Exilus Adapter\n4 x Weapon Slots\nEvergreen Choices B (choose one):\n50,000 Kuva\n7-day Boosters (Affinity, Credits, Resource)\n30,000 Endo\nEvergreen Choices C (choose one):\n3 x Rifle Riven\n3 x Melee Riven\n3 x Secondary Riven\nScaling Day-to-day: Scale all the things!\n     \nOne important thing to clarify is that the in-game items received on the non-Milestone Days in Daily Tribute system now scale based on the amount of days you have logged on. Endo is an example well documented in the past Workshop, but this also applies to Credits, Booster Durations, Resources, Syndicate Medallions, Relics, and Forma Blueprints.\nThe way this Scaling works is that we have chosen a base amount of a given item and applied a multiplier that reflects your current amount of Days logged in \nit does vary by item type!\nFor example, on Day 1 I get 1 x Tellurium, but on Day 1000 I get 6 x Tellurium!\nAdditional Information:\n\nThere is now a fixed Day 5 Reward of 25,000 Credits and 1000 Endo.\nOur goal is to make it only slightly more flexible while still respecting the core need to login frequently. Personalization is a huge part of Warframe and we think that this changes the Daily Tribute system to better reflect that. \nThe Lodestar Syandana and the Lodestar Armor Set \nthey are staying at Day 800 / 1000 respectively.\nWe have added custom lines and videos to each Daily Tribute which brings a Warframe NPC out to greet you on your new day.\nWe recently made the surprising discovery that Miasma’s damage multiplier for targets affected by Spores never actually worked. It has been fixed and will now work as we’ve intended it to originally. That said, seeing as it has been absent until now, we have increased the damage multiplier from 2x to 4x to encourage even more synergy between the two abilities.\nSeasoned Saryn players will notice the change immediately, as it can make quite an impact on the spread of Spores via Miasma kills. By increasing the damage multiplier we have reduced the following to compensate for the change:\nMiasma base Damage has been halved.\nSpores scaling damage per second cap has been reduced from 10 to 7.\nAs always, we watch for your feedback and encourage you thoroughly test out the changes first before leaving your thoughts. Thank you!\nAs we have added more complex Operator outfits and Armor Sets, we've made revisions to the some of the existing cosmetics to allow for better sharing of aesthetics among sets. There are now new seams on the shoulders, neck, and waist of multiple outfits which will make mix & matching less jarring!\nRevenant’s Reave wall width is now affected by Range Mods.\nRevenant’s Reave now also sheds Status Effects on cast and applies them to targets it hits.\nFixed Revenant's Thralls not granting Affinity when killed. \nFixed Revenant’s Danse Macabre being able to damage Nullifier bubbles (and then killing the Nullifier).\nFixed enemies affected by Revenant’s Enthrall and then a Radiation Status Effect being able to enthrall the Defense target, preventing the wave from ever ending.\nFixed Revenant Reave not using Modded Health/Shield steal values.\nFixed Revenant’s Reave Abilities page not properly showing the Modded Health/Shield steal values.\nFixed Revenant’s Thrall death pillars blocking projectiles.\nFixed various Syandana clipping issues with Revenant.\nPhantasma’s Alt Fire homing projectile amount is no longer based on charge time. Alt Fire now releases 5 total homing projectiles.\nPhantasma’s Alt Fire damage per projectile now scales based on charge time.\n\nOver 40 FX Decorations and 7 structural Decorations have been added for your decorating enjoyment!\nA brand new Sandbox room has been added! Check your Dojo Room Building options for the 'INSPIRATION HALL'! This empty great hall is a blank slate awaiting inspired designers!\nAll Display Decorations are now usable in Dojos, as well as a 'Text' Decoration!\nThe Clan Chat tab now displays the following Clan activity in green:\nPlayer left Clan\nPlayer invited \nPlayer joined \nColor Research started or unpaused\nPlayer Hierarchy change \nClan Tier change \nA confirmation prompt now appears when a Clan Chat Moderator attempts to kick/ban a player.\nAdded a toggle to ‘Show All’ or ‘Hide Owned Blueprints’ in the Energy, Bio, Orokin, and Chem Labs.\nAdded 3 more options in the Contribution screen under Alliance header for donating Credits, Decorations, and Resources to other Allied Clans.\nInitiates can no longer purchase/replicate Clan Research (contributing allowed). This prevents new recruits from joining and bailing once they have taken their fill of Research.\nYou can now toggle ‘Disable Operator’ on/off from the Dojo Obstacle Course console at the entrance of the room!\nThe Clan screen now displays the remaining time to those who have not yet participated in the Ascension Ceremony (if one is active). \nAmmo is now successfully restored when a Dojo Duel is over.\nImproved visibility of the room rotate button in the Dojo Architect menu, and added shortcut indicators for mouse and keyboard, and for controllers. \nAdded “Duplicate” button to Dojo (and Orbiter) Decoration modes. Pressing it duplicates the aimed at Decoration, including its scale (where applicable) and rotation.\n\nFrom the desk of Audio Director George:‘We started working on Melee 3.0 sounds and made so many cool improvements to low-level things like hit effects, Foley, field-of-view, and general sound cleanup that we wanted to get it out ASAP.  We still have a bunch of new sounds that will be releasing with the full Melee 3.0 overhaul as well.’\n\nNew impact sounds for all Melee weapons.\nNew slam sounds for all Melee weapons.\nNew heavy attack sounds for all Melee weapons.\nNew slide attack sounds for all Melee weapons.\nAdded Melee sounds to Valkyr’s Hysteria ability.\nCleaned up Melee weapon sounds when hitting floors and walls during combat.\nRemoved music occlusion when bullet jumping.\nShortened default Stasis Recovery time from 3 hours to 30 minutes. \nChanged cost of Stasis Rush cost from 10 Platinum to 10,000 Credits.\nTenno with the Nutrio Incubator Segment installed now have instant recovery from Stasis at no cost!\nReduced Platinum cost of Companion Name Change from 25 to 15 Platinum to match weapon entitlement costs.\nRemoved pickup limit on Kubrow Eggs!\nAdded a progress wheel to UI to show Antitoxin Strength.\nhttps://imgur.com/XSGu2MD \nAntitoxin console disables when strength is at 100% to avoid wasting Antitoxins.\nSlightly increased strength score of common and uncommon Antitoxins. \nFixed incorrect Affinity reward scaling for Antitoxins.\nFixed broken materials on the Antitoxin console.\nDisabled the “Change Loadout” button from appearing when an invite is up on screen. Additionally disabled the “Invite” button from appearing at the same time. The invite must now be dismissed before trying to invite someone to your game. This fixes the issue of being unable to accept invites while on Navigation using a controller since X opened the “Change Loadout” screen.\nWe no longer force double-click to equip Arcanes when playing on a controller.\nChanged controller D-Pad icons to a solid button shape.\nAdded quick button (X) for the Invite Button on the Invite Player screen when using a controller. Option can still be selected with the Virtual Cursor if desired.\nController icon callouts will now be displayed for currently bound actions when changing bindings. \nFixed missing button callouts when placing decorations in the Dojo while using a controller. \nFixed attempting to place decorations in Dojo by selecting the “Decorate” option doing nothing while using a controller. \nFixed virtual cursor not highlighting options in the Dojo Room Options window while using a controller, making it unselectable. \nFixed terms and policies text and Start button under the Warframe logo on login screen being incorrectly positioned when using a controller. \nFixed being unable to select Warframes after purchasing a few Warframes consecutively while using a controller. \nFixed an issue where pressing the pause menu button on controller causing a brief UI transition to mouse mode. \nFixed being unable to move cursor with the D-Pad or use most quick buttons while searching for an item in your inventory using the on screen keyboard with a controller. \nFixed D-Pad navigation going to the category tabs when attempting to modify some options near the top of the screen.\nFixed the Clan search screen not having D-pad functionality. \nFixed an issue with D-pad functionality not working on Polychrome in the Dojo. \nFixed an issue where a list would 'snap back to top' when scrolling with a Controller. \nFixed pressing the tutorial button in the Upgrade menu in the Arsenal incorrectly showing combos instead of the Modding tutorial when using a controller.\nFixed being unable to back out of the Market after opening chat and selecting an item while using a controller. \nFixed customizing your Operator causing them to spin while using a controller. \nFixed being unable to select the Taveuni node on the Kuva Fortress if highlighting the text with the cursor while using controller.\nFixed kills achieved by Warframe Abilities that summon AI (Rumblers, Shadows, etc) not counting towards Conclave Challenges.\nFixed an issue where ending a Conclave match with a Radiation Status Effect would treat you as if you were on the opposing team.\nFixed not being able to pick up the Cephalon if it was dropped in the air in Conclave.\nFixed Cephalon Carrier time not resetting upon getting a kill in any Dedicated Server matches.\nFixed Lunaro lobby lighting being too bright to show team flag designs in Conclave.\n",

  "changes": "We have a big batch of changes to Revenant based on constructive player feedback. Specifics per ability follow below, but a big thanks to everyone who took the time to login, play, and visit a space (forums or otherwise) to give their thoughts. It's crucial to the iteration process. Thank you!\nTHRALLS: We have made changes to have Thralls have more value in life AND death \njust as Revenant did. The general rule Thralls will follow is they provide CC in Life, Damage in Death. The goal is simply to have an easy supply of Thralls to make use of in both Life and Death.\nCurrently Enthrall has the following uses:\nWHILE ALIVE:\nYou can get up to 7 enemies Crowd Controlled \nthey won't attack you or allies and will draw Aggro from AI.\nIt spreads / is transferred \nthe Enthralled state is contagious!\nYou can Reave Thralls for greater scaling Health and Shield Leeching.\nIf Thralls are killed by Danse Macabre, overshield drops are created.\nAFTER DEATH:\nIt creates a damaging pillar, and that's it. Not useful enough in death at all!\nADDITIONAL After Death:\nWe've added the following with this update: \nWhile active, the pillar creates homing projectiles similar to the Vomvalyst attacks and Revenant's Signature weapon, the Phantasma!\nThe pillars can now be exploded to output their damage radially if hit by Danse Macabre.\nOn the development build before release, Mesmer Skin was recastable but we removed this due to balance concerns. But, our gut reaction was right and thanks to your feedback we've changed it back to how it was and you can now recast Mesmer Skin to recharge it!\nLowered Energy cost to 50.\nRevenant is now fully immune to damage while Reaving \nit's meant to be a life-saver! \nWhen Reaving Thralls with Mesmer Skin active, it restores a charge.\nWhen Reaving Allies with Mesmer Skin active, it adds the protective energy to your allies who happen to be in range. A small protective bonus!\nWhen REAVE is cast while in DANSE MACABRE, Energy cost lowered to 25. This allows for quicker, risk-free placement of Revenant for tactical maneuvering.\nThe Direction of Reave now follows last Reticle aim point which makes casting more responsive to intent.\nOxium Ospreys now appear within the first 5 Waves/Rounds of all Corpus Defense/Interception missions.\nSlightly increased the spawn chance of Oxium Ospreys in all Corpus Defense/Interception missions at higher Waves/Rounds.\nA ‘Founding Warlord’ Role has been added to the Clan hierarchy! This hierarchy is above ‘Warlord’ and there can only be one. Founding Warlord has all the permissions of a Warlord, but can also freely change the rank of any member. They also have the option of promoting any Warlord to Founding Warlord. This uses the new type of confirmation where you must type a keyword (in this case \"PROMOTE\") to go through with the change. The Founding Warlord now becomes visible to others and cannot leave the Clan unless they are the only member or promotes another Warlord to Founding Warlord. If a Founding Warlord wishes to be demoted, they must promote another Warlord, thus switching the Roles. If a Clan has a Founder already set (via Support), that person is automatically given the Founding Warlord Role (even if they weren't Warlord), otherwise the Warlord with oldest join date is made Founding Warlord.\nThis also alleviates a longstanding issue where the Founder of a Clan can leave, but they are still considered the Founder if they come back (and if they don't, the Clan has no member with Founder status).\nReworked the Vault contribution screen to reduce the number of steps you must take to contribute. You can also now browse the Resources and Decorations in the Vault! Previously you could only Donate and never knew what was already in there.\nRhino now has a HUD buff indicator for his Iron Skin!\nReduced numerous costs of required items for various quantity locked activities. Less grind more grofit:\nReduced the cost of Nav Coordinates required to craft the Mutalist Alad V Assassinate Key from 3 to 1.\nReduced the cost of Animo Beacons required to fight Ambulas on Pluto, Hades from 40 to 20.\nReduced the cost of Vestan Moss scans required to craft the Sunrise Apothic from 25 to 12. \nChanged Health Conversion to only remove stacks on Health damage. Previously it removed stacks on any damage, which was counterproductive when the damage was on Shields as they are not affected by Armor.\nThe emissive on Operator Facial Accessories is now controlled by suit Energy colour.\nIncreased the Anspatha Brace recharge from 30/s to 45/s.\nMade some micro-optimizations to AI path-finding.\nMade some micro-optimizations to some core math routines used by Visibility and Zoning.\nMade some micro-optimizations to Zoning code used by Sound Effects, Cameras, and Weather Effects.\nMade a micro-optimization to runtime object creation.\nMade a small optimization to the process of binding textures and samplers (dx11 only).\nReduced the smoothing window for the frame rate/time values. This may make things like Dynamic Vsync kick in a bit more promptly.\nImproved AI pathing in the Corpus Gas City tileset to reduce enemy crowding in certain areas.\nRemoved ability to unintentionally equip Hydraulic Crosshairs and Sharpened Bullets on Mesa’s Regulators. Although the buff appeared to trigger, it never actually applied due to the \"on aim\" criteria not being fulfilled (unless you had a very specific loadout with the Mesa Waltz Augment equipped).\nResource descriptions now indicate their \"Locations/where to find\" list to aid new players.\nRemoved special Warframe HUDs (Nidus, etc) from being displayed in the Dojo.\nReverted an unintentional reduction of Revenant’s max Energy. His max Energy is now as it was before 23.8.0.\nChanged Nezha’s Fire Walker to only ‘hop’ when cast while on the floor.\n",
  "fixes": "\n\n\n[DE]Pablo has been working hard on tweaks, with two primary goals in mind:\nMaking Nezha feel smoother and more fluid in gameplay\nIncreasing Nezha’s power overall by giving him added team support value and internal synergies\nWith that said, let’s break down the changes in order!\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\nIncreased max rank health from 225 to 375\nDecreased max rank shields from 225 to 150\nChanged from a channeling ability to duration-based.\nWhy? As a channeled ability, keeping Firewalker active would block all energy regeneration. Making the ability a single cast with a long moddable duration solves that problem, encouraging more frequent use.\nCast animation changed to a small hop that doesn’t restrict movement.\n\n\nCast animation has been sped up, and no longer restricts movement.\nEnemies hit by the disc are “marked” for a moddable duration, greatly increasing the damage they take from all sources. Marked enemies have a chance to drop energy orbs.\nWhy? Adds great team value to Nezha’s kit \nincreasing damage taken helps all allies, and energy orb drops enable frequent recasting.\n\nKilling enemies while they are marked will now produce healing orbs, instead of the current healing pulse.\nWhy? The current radial heal is invisible and very small, usually only benefitting players in melee range \nmost players don’t even know it’s there! Health orbs make the result more visible, while introducing other mod synergies.\nIncreased the number of targets the disc will try to hit before recalling, and improved some cases of faulty lock-on targeting.\nAdded a charged throw, causing the Chakram to fly straight forwards and backwards, dealing extra damage to enemies in its path.\nWhy? For a consistent flight path unaffected by lock-on targeting, use the new charged throw. Great for hallways!\n\nTeleporting will no longer cancel Fire Walker.\nHUD now shows a custom counter, indicating how much damage absorption is left, instead of a simple numeric percentage\n\nWarding Halo now only blocks 90% of damage taken. Will still block status effects and other procs.\nWhy? When considering Nezha’s revamped kit, he is excellent at mitigating enemy damage \nFirewalker and Divine Spears offer great area/crowd control, Blazing Chakram offers healing and self-sustain, and his outstanding movement can make the player a hard target to hit. In this context, Warding Halo’s 100% damage resistance was completely overshadowing his other options \nwhy heal or CC when I never take any damage?\nWith 90% damage resistance, Nezha is still very capable of tanking, but encouraged to rely on his other tools to avoid getting overwhelmed. Taking minimal health damage allows for synergy with Blazing Chakram’s health orbs, not to mention new modding avenues like Equilibrium, Health Conversion and various Arcanes. The change also allows us to improve survivability in other ways, such as the increased health pool, and major Warding Halo quality-of-life buffs listed below.\nDamage absorption invulnerability phase now begins as soon as you cast the ability. Cast animation also sped up.\n\nIncreased incoming damage multiplier during invulnerability. Damage absorption multiplier also now scales with power strength.\nWhen the health of the Warding Halo runs out, it will do an AoE heat status effect and give you a short period of invulnerability.\nWhy? This gives the player precious time to react, helping survivability while controlling the enemies immediately around you. Your next Warding Halo can be recast during this window to ensure you’re always protected!\n\n(Brief aside: as a Nezha main, I was originally skeptical of the 90% damage resistance change, and I suspect many readers will be skeptical too. However, playing the rework myself quickly changed my mind. The various buffs really outweigh the negatives, making Nezha much more capable in a supporting crowd-controller role. If you doubt just how potent 90% damage resistance can be, try out Gara’s Splinter Storm at 130% or more power strength!)\nSped up the casting/slamming animations, while removing the mandatory slam at the end of the Spears’ duration. (slam can still be triggered manually)\nHitting a speared enemy with Blazing Chakram produces a second Chakram, which fires at a nearby enemy.\n\nOn top of all that, Nezha’s sounds have been remastered, adding new auditory cues for important moments, like Blazing Chakrams returning to the player, or Warding Halos running out of health!\n\nSlight improvements to Blazing Chakram’s enemy tracking.\nPlayers will receive a HUD icon indicating the Health of a Safeguard Halo they received from Nezha.\nFixed Revenant’s Reave using the wrong value (Health) for Shield gain.\nFixed inability to damage Revenant’s Enthralled enemies with the Arca Plasmor.\nFixed Revenant’s Enthralled enemies still attempting to hack terminals during Interception missions. \nFixed Gara’s Mass Vitrify blocking Revenant’s Danse Macabre lasers.\nFixed Revenant’s Danse Macabre and Strangledome names being in ALL CAPS.\nFixed a progression stopper in the Sands of Inaros quest as a result of the first phase of the boss fight being skipped and Inaros becoming invulnerable. Also fixed the Tomb Protector in Sands of Inaros attacking while invisible and having floating weapons instead of being entombed while you fight the Golems.\nPotential fix for crashes when transitioning between Cetus and the Plains of Eidolon.\nFixed a crash that could occur if two people managed to tether themselves together (Nyx Chaos or Radiation Status Effect on two Grineer Scorpions, two M-W.A.M. Brokers in the Index, etc).\nFixes towards crashes caused by input repeating from held-down buttons (Spearfishing wheel, etc).\nFixed inability to equip Sinister Reach on the Phantasma.\nFixed ability to trigger Exodia Arcanes on Exalted Melee weapons. Exodia Arcanes still apply to Zaws, just not in Exalted Melee (Excalibur, Valkyr, etc) form.\nFixed being able to spawn more enemies/crash the game by spamming the 'Simulate' button in the Simulacrum.\nFixed ability to spawn an infinite amount of Corrupted Heavy Gunner Specters instead of the new Corrupted Heavy Gunner replacing the old one.\nFixed Transferring to Operator in a Void Fissure mission overwriting squadmates' Reactant counter UI.\nFixed the Anspatha Brace recharge rate not showing up in the Operator Arsenal stats.\nFixed issue where when Donating Decorations/Resources, it would also donate 1 Credit to Vault as well.\nFixed John Prodman spawning but is nowhere to be found in The Index.\nFixed Clients scanning their last Frame Fighter Fragment, getting the poster locally, but then losing it after a Host migration.\nIf you are in the affected pool please message http://support.warframe.com/ to get your Frame Fighter poster!\nFixed inability to see how many Stars are in your Ayatan Sculptures when trading them to another player. \nFixed accessing the Menu within the Ayatan Treasures screen resulting in the Menu being displaying in the background.\nFixed being able to use purchasable UI Themes that you did not purchase.\nFixed Warframe Ability banner showing when playing with controller even with the ‘Show Ability Banner On Cast’ setting is disabled.\nFixed the Zylok’s \"low clip\" sound from being audible everywhere.\nFixed voice sounds for Rana Del (Index).\nFixed Squad info panel displaying filepaths when accepting a Bounty.\nFixed blank characters in Set Mod descriptions. \nFixed broken code in text when Consigning a pet in Spanish.\nFixed Riven Challenge descriptions containing incorrect icons.\nFixed a script error when using Octavia’s Conductor Augment.\nFixed edge case script error that could occur if you received a game invite while loading into a mission.\nFixed script error in when joining a Dojo Duel if the Duel had been cancelled while the join was in-progress.\nFixed a crash when casting Rhino’s Roar ability.\nFixed a crash when casting and teleporting with Nezha’s Blazing Chakram ability.\nFixed a crash when casting Nezha’s Warding Halo ability.\nFixed a crash when loading into certain levels.\nFixed a crash when hijacking a Dargyn.\nFixed a possible crash when your Sentinel died.\nFixed a script error when trying to join a squad that had already disbanded.\nFixed Clients Transferring to Operator and back resulting in Revenant’s Mesmer Skin charge indicator being removed on the ability UI.\nFixed another crash from casting Nezha’s Warding Halo ability.\nFixed a crash when casting Nezha’s Divine Spears ability.\nFixed Revenant Reave being capable of flying.\n",

  "changes": "The Sacrifice: Update 23:\nWho would have thought that we’d be launching our third cinematic quest. With the ambitious goal of telling Warframe’s story in a way we had never done before, The Second Dream started it all. The moments you shared with us while playing through the quest is a memory all of us at Digital Extremes will never forget. So we thought… wow, we did it… Can we do it again? And so it was, we burned heaps of midnight oil to launch The War Within and experience the roller coaster of feels with you all over again.\nWitnessing your reaction to THE SACRIFICE teaser we showed at TennoCon last year is an emotion we can’t quite put into words. We’re pretty sure you guys shook the convention center and the internet. So we’re absolutely ecstatic that you can now continue your journey as Tenno in the Warframe universe in this new quest.\nFrom all of us at Digital Extremes, thank you for sharing Warframe with us. This once small but growing studio in London, Ontario couldn’t have done any of this without your extraordinary support, Tenno.\nWe hope that you have enjoyed the ride so far. We look forward to seeing what Warframe has in store for all of us as we look toward the future.\nThe Apostasy Prologue left a memento from the Lotus lingering in the Orbiter, calling back to the moment Ballas extended his hand to her. As they faded beyond grasp, nothing but fragmented transmissions from her remained.\nNow, a foreboding vision leads the Tenno to hunt for a savage Warframe. Will you unmask the truth in this mind-bending new chapter of the cinematic storyline? THE SACRIFICE will bring you closer to uncovering what has fallen into shadow.\nTHE SACRIFICE Quest is available after completing The Second Dream, The War Within, Chains of Harrow and the Apostasy Prologue, and will be available in your Codex upon login. Bring your best Warframe and Operator loadouts to face the challenges that await you in THE SACRIFICE .\n\nCurrently, we have exactly 131 screens in Warframe that need an artistic pass to the new style. 8 are done and ready to go \nthey're here today! Themes similar to above are coming for the screens we have completed, and all subsequent screens will inherit whatever UI theme you've chosen (default or other purchased themes).\nWe have also have 2 free Themes specifically tailored for our visually impaired and color blind Tenno: the “Equinox Theme” (B&W theme) and the “High Contrast Theme”! We’d love to get your feedback on them so that we can increase Warframe’s accessibility:\n\nTo change your UI theme, go to your Interface Options and select “UI Customization”.\n\nThere you can also change your Background from the 3 available options:\nEquinox Background\nLegacy Background\nVitruvian Background\nYou can also change the UI sounds from the “Legacy” and “Vitruvian” options.\nPlease see our Developer Workshop for more information:\n\n\nWarframes with unique Ability-driven (Exalted) Weapons can now be separately Modded in your Arsenal! This includes the ability to customize their appearance too!\nExcalibur/Prime’s Exalted Blade \nWe gave the Blade a partial physical design (hilt) so that you can customize its appearance (Energy color is still determined by Excalibur’s)! \nIvara’s Artemis Bow \nMesa’s Regulators \nIf you own or purchase the Mesa Presidio Skin, you will automatically receive the  Presidio Regulators skin to equip onto Mesa’s Regulators.\nTitania’s Dex Pixia + Diwata\nValkyr/Prime’s Talons\nNo customizing since her Talons’ design is all Energy-based!\nWukong’s Iron Staff\nExalted Weapons work in the following ways:\nThey appear in your Arsenal as an unranked moddable Weapon option once you’ve unlocked the Ability. \nAll Exalted weapons use the Mod classes expected for the class of weapon.\nMelee Exalted Weapons have their Stance Mod permanently displayed in the modding UI with access to Combos!\nTitania’s Dex Pixia now uses Secondary Mods! More on that in the Titania Exalted Weapons Dev Workshop we posted at the beginning of this week.\nWhile Exalted Weapons can be ranked, they do not count towards Mastery Rank (with the exception of Khora’s Venari). \nRiven Mods are not generated for Exalted Weapons.\nLimbo's Stasis has been changed to make it more cooperative! Now, Stasis only stops time for Enemies. Limbo's Gear and all Ally Gear will continue to function. But, because complete time-halting for enemies within the Rift is akin to godly power, the duration of the ability has been shortened overall \nfrom base 30 seconds to 15 seconds. This is of course affected by Mods.\nPlease see our Developer Workshop for more information:\n\n\nThe launch of virtual cursor controls on consoles brought many hotfixes to those platforms with much needed changes and improvements. Our first Dev Workshop looked at bringing D-Pad Functionality, while our second, a follow-up Action Plan, looked at what we planned on improving across platforms. Combined, the following changes are now live for our PC controller players:\nD-Pad support is here!  \nRestored button shortcuts in the Arsenal. \nChanged Relic selection windows to preview content on hover. To choose a Relic, simply select it. \nAdded the ability to auto-rotate your Warframe in the Arsenal (using the Right Trigger) while browsing item grid. \nChanged “preview” and “select” to be independent of one another in the Arsenal item selection (separate bindings displayed in bottom right of screen in Arsenal).\nRemoved the need to hold down and drag in order to select a Mod in the Modding UI. Instead, selecting a Mod will make it stick to your cursor like it used to, allowing you to move it with cursor control or D-Pad. Additionally, hitting “back” will deselect the Mod from your cursor without exiting the screen. \nIncreased the size of Star Chart node hitzones when using a controller.\nFixed category switch with controller LB/RB on some screens when hovering over a category button.\nFixed not being able to fish with Classic Controls.\nFixed LB prompt in Ability Menu appearing permanently after opening fishing gear wheel. \nFixed the cursor on controller moving to an arbitrary spot in the Inventory Sort Options drop down.\nFixed cursor automatically snapping to a button on the right side of the screen if a menu is open.\nFixed being unable to rotate your Operator while customizing with the Right Stick when your cursor is hovering over the item menu.  \nFixed being unable to rotate your Operator at all after fast traveling to the Transference room from “Operator” in the pause menu. \nFixed the “X” callout button missing from the Lunaro Practice Mode, which made it appear that the Practice Mode could not be activated. \nFixed button to send Amp Slots as a gift not actually sending the gift when using a controller. \nFixed controller RB and LB loss of functionality after accessing Navigation, opening matchmaking and then pressing B to back out.\nFixed pause menu button on controller causing a brief UI transition to mouse mode.\nThanks to your feedback, we are continuing our work to improve the cursor experience overall. To stay updated on the changes/fixes we are working on, visit our feedback thread here.\nIncreased Excalibur Prime’s Armor from 250 to 300.\nTeralyst, Gantulyst, and Hydrolyst no longer have regenerated Shields immediately after teleporting from being stuck.\nIncreased Titania’s Diwata damage to 200, Critical Chance to 20% and Critical Multiplier to 2x.\nSlightly lowered the Battalyst and Conculyst's base health from 1300 to 1150.\nSlightly reduced the Battalyst's projectile damage.\nYou can now include “&” in your Zaw weapon Entitling.\nGeneral audio polish for Sanctuary Onslaught.\nFollowing what we started in our previous mainline, we’ve made thousands more micro-optimizations to hundreds of scripts, including Warframe Powers, Precepts, Enemy Logic, Weapon Behaviors, Game-Modes, and the UI.\nAncient and Scorpion grappling hooks no longer go through Gara’s Mass Vitrify wall.\nMoved UI Cursor Sensitivity setting from “Controls” to “Interface”.\nMoved Cetus Wisp and Maprico Tree spawn points a bit further away from water volumes in the NW corner of the Plains for gathering ease.\nAfter the target is captured in Capture missions, the level alert levels will automatically turn off after 1 minute, and enemy spawns will stop after 2 minutes.  \nUpdated the LOC for Banshee’s Sound Quake Augment to “Forgoes channeling to create a shockwave that deals 20x damage at the epicenter, gradually weakening as it expands out\".\nStunning or knocking down Conculysts during their whirlwind ability and Battalysts during their omnidirectional laser ability now cancels the ability. \nRemoved Steam controller icons from the list of selectable sets and swapped them with the Xbox One icons.\nRemoved the “Max Enemy Count Reached” message from Simulacrum enemy selector when first opening it and selecting enemies. It will now only appear when you attempt to spawn enemies and there isn't enough space. It will also no longer clear your previous selection when it happens to be over the limit when you first open it.\nPunch Through Mods no longer affect the Zenith’s Alternate Fire deployable disc.\nGPU particles are now part of melee slam sparks by default.\nIncreased the size of Focus Lens icons to be more on par with the size of Forma, Mastery, and other icons.\nOptimized the Survival HUD slightly. This also fixes problems caused by playing with VSync disabled and joining a mission in progress with a poor network connection.\nUpdated “Show Friend Invite Notifications” in your Gameplay options to “Show Friend Request Notifications” and “Receive Friend Invites From”  to “Receive Friend Requests From”. \nImproved Decoration Placement camera collision.\nUpdated some of the structures in the Corpus Gas City tileset.\nOperator Hoods will appear open and Masks removed when they are involved in a cut scene.\n",

Check out the Spores Revisited Dev Workshop!\nWant to share your feedback on the changes above? Post your thoughts (after thoroughly testing all the changes) in the Spores Revisited Feedback Megathread.\nMelee attacks now freely pass through enemies in Range (i.e an enemy cannot block another enemy from being hit).\nIncreased the default speed of controller cursor and made it slower in Star Chart only.\nYou can now use ‘Enter’ to accept input prompts or (A) on controller instead of (X) (choosing Mod stacks, etc).\nIncreased the fade out time for Star Chart ambient and Star chart percussion music.\nRemoved the glowing in-world marker from Quill Onkko. \nOptimized loading screens.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed only being able to damage the Nullifier Bubble if you have line-of-sight to the Nullifier.\nFixed some inconsistencies with melee sweeps where sometimes it doesn't hit a visible avatar or the sweep goes through the floor. \nFixed Warframe kills not counting towards Onslaught Efficiency when the player is controlling their Operator.\nFixed ‘Sellable Only’ option applying to Fish/Ducat Kiosk/Relic screens, which resulted in nothing showing up. This lead to players believing they did not have any of their freshly caught Fish in their inventories upon returning to Cetus.\nFixed Apothic not getting consumed until the end of the mission, at which Clients can rejoin as many times as they want and reuse their Apothics. \nFixed the \"Invite Squad member\" button or the \"Show profile\" dropdown not functioning after viewing the Inventory.\nFixed Dark split Sword appearing as unranked for Clients at the beginning of a mission even though it's ranked.\nFixed Despot Syandana and Sovereign Syandana cloth getting caught on numerous Warframes.\nFixed paused enemies becoming unpaused when disarmed in the Simulacrum.\nFixed turning off 'Pause AI' not unpausing currently paused enemies in the Simulacrum.\nFixed the new Ceramic Dagger PBR material not applying custom Energy color.\nFixed changing a Warframes colours back to default not saving after a mission and reverts back to the colours that were on the Warframe before entering the mission.\nFixed Kavat interaction animation sometimes being incorrect immediately after retrieving the Kavat from Stasis.\nFixed Titania's bullet jump area of effect buff FX not showing up.\nFixed various issues with customized Dojo lighting being applied to the wrong areas.\nFixed not being able to fund Polychrome construction when changing to default lighting colors in the Dojo.\nFixed being unable to select a Glyph with the Display Glyph Decoration.\nFixed ALT-Enter only allowing fullscreen toggle sometimes (during cinematics mostly).\nFixed selecting ‘Add Filter’ in Chat with the controller resulting in a disabled controller hotkey to add a Filter.\nFixed the ‘Sellable Only’ option not being registered to the D-Pad for controllers.\nFixed t-posing Zephyr when switching from Equinox to Zephyr.\nFixed dynamic music not playing for Clients in Onslaught (or sometimes for anyone at all in certain tiles).\nFixed some sounds only being heard by the Host as reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/958946-host-sound-effects-locality/\nFixed crashing upon using the G3 Beacon Gear Item.\nFixed a script error when trying to purchase Focus Capacity in the main Focus screen (outside of any specific tree).\nFixed a Venari script error in rare cases where the player's Warframe is not available (ex.

The Bounty will now attempt to procure a spawn location for the Target for 30 seconds, and if it fails, the Bounty will successfully advance. Geometry and split-second timing play into factor here, and failing a Bounty due to unavoidable situations does not grant Konzu his early lunch!\nExiting the Relic selection menu now counts as a non-vote instead of a decline. Previously ‘Exiting’ from the Relic selection screen counted as \"declining\" the mission, which you could not undo unless you left the squad, or the mission is cancelled entirely.\nYou can now trade the Peculiar Growth Mod!\nImproved velocity and friction of small UI button targeting with a controller.\nImproved AI navigation in the Grineer Shipyard tileset.\nReduced the loading/Star Chart percussion loop.\n",

Switch between Equipment, Focus, and Appearance. \n \nNew percussion-driven music has been added to the Star Chart and loading screens.\nReal-time audio mixing is now handled by our new RTPC (Real-Time Parameter Control) system, which allows greater precision and control of the game-wide mix:\nReal-time audio mixing is now decoupled from music, so players who don’t want to play with music benefit from the new RTPC system.\nPlayer speed will now adjust footstep/sliding volume.\nBullet sound volume when the local player is being hit by enemies is now based on Shields/Health.\nThe RTPC system also allows cleaner and more focused music during heavy combat\nStarchat music will now be affected by the Music slider and not the SFX slider\nAdded a North indicator to both the Plains of Eidolon minimap and Advanced Map. Cetus is due South, so players need only walk in the opposite direction of this marking to head home for an early lunch! \nAdded a ‘Show Ability Banner on Cast’ toggle to the Interface Options menu! This is off by default on PC. Console players already have these banners appear automatically, but they will have the option to turn them off once this change goes live on Xbox One and PS4!\n  \nAdded the ability to replay the Once Awake quest !\nAdded the repurposed Kuva Defense tile used in Kuva Survival Missions to other Fortress missions. \nObjects that attract weapon-fire, like Mag’s Magnetize ability, now do so in a more logical way:\n   \nAdded a 'CLAIM ALL' button to the Foundry that appears when you have more than 1 item ready to Claim.\nWeekly Leaderboards will now show a reset timer!\n",
  "changes": "Beasts Of The Sanctuary: Update 22.20.0:\nOur lady of poison is taking the center stage with Saryn Revisited 2.0! Yes, that’s right! She has been revisited for a second time, and this time we took a closer look at increasing the fun factor by removing layers of complicated synergies and giving Toxin Lash and Molt a long deserved encore.\nRead all about our intent and full details on the changes in the official Saryn Revisited 2.0 Dev Workshop!\nIncreased Status Chance from 10% to 50% (scales with Ability Strength). \nA meter in the bottom right corner of your screen will show the number of affected enemies and how much damage is being dealt per tick to said enemies.\nRecasting Spores detonates all active Spores and will deal 2x the damage on an inflicted enemy based on the number of active Spores and the current damage per tick. \nVenom Dose Augment: Spores cast on allies temporarily grant them additional Corrosive damage to all attacks.\nAfter casting, Saryn receives a momentary speed boost for a short duration. \nMolt now scales similar to Rhino’s Iron Skin \nAll the initial damage it takes in the first 3 seconds will make it stronger. Any damage it receives after that point will target the absorbed health.*\n*Damage absorbed is shown in a buff indicator at the top of the screen.\n*Once all absorbed damage has dispensed, Molt explodes dealing Toxin damage to nearby enemies.\nNow has a 100% guaranteed Viral Status Effect on damage tick. \nIncreased range from 15 meters to 20 meters (at max rank). \nIncreased duration from 3 to 5 seconds.\nMiasma inflicts double damage on targets affected by Spores. \nWhen recasting on the same enemy it will refresh the tick duration and maintain the Viral Status Effect, but will not stun enemies a second time until the Status Effect ticks have subsided.\nIncreased Saryn’s Armor from 175 to 225 (at rank 30)\nIncreased Saryn Prime’s Armor from 225 to 300 (at rank 30) \nMade some minor FX updates to Saryn’s abilities! \nSpores received a slight improvement to the FX.\nReduced the brightness of Miasma.\nImproved FX to make her Molt cast more pronounced.\nSpores have been optimized and will be much nicer to your CPU! \nSaryn is also coming with a whole new set of sounds voiced by [DE]Danielle!! \nAdded Abilities screen stats for Saryn Molt speed buff & duration.\nWe hope you enjoy experimenting with her changes. We will be watching closely for your first impressions. As always, we appreciate your constructive feedback and encourage you to thoroughly play with the rework before sharing your thoughts: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/957215-update-2220-saryn-revisted-20-feedback-megathread/\n\nIf you recall, we added enhanced Dojo Decorating earlier this year with some other minor changes. Part 2 has arrived, and it brings with it new visuals and a highly anticipated room!\n\nDisappearing platforms!\nDeadly frickin lasers and pressure-pads that you should avoid at all costs!\nDummies you need to kill to complete the course!\nAnd much more!\nAdded 37 Tenno Decorations and 54 Orokin Decorations for your Dojo renovating pleasure!\nAdded new Pigment colors dropped by the following enemies: \nShard Black: Vomvalysts \nTower White: Condrocs \nDevar Grey: Tusk Bombard \nWisp Grey: Skiff Pilot \nMortus Pink: Kuakas\nDid you miss our Dev Workshop!? Read it quickly here \nit's short:\n\nWe have added 'GPU Particles' which replace the no-longer-supported Nvidia PhysX Particles. These GPU Particles can be enjoyed on all Platforms with varying intensity:\nOff/Low/Medium/High... LUDICROUS!\nMany particle FX have been converted, but we will spend some time continuing to upgrade our catalog throughout the year. Our new system is universal, works on almost all GPUs (really old ones might be out of luck), is not locked to a given manufacturer, and is not locked to PC! Console Tenno will receive this next update!\n\nIf you watched Devstream 110, you might already be familiar with our plans to change the Scrambus and Comba. Players can now engage in more cerebral combat with these enemies, using visual cues to take them down:\n\nTheir Nullify aura has been replaced with a power that they can activate in combat. Upon use, it creates an expanding sphere that nuffilies players’ powers, and disrupts them for 2.5 seconds.\n \nSimilar to the way shooting the Nullifier bubble or weak point can interrupt or prevent the aura from spreading, shooting off Scrambus/Comba’s helmet (or killing them) will negate the sphere:\n\n\n\n\nWith today’s update, you are now able to acquire an active Dargyn in the following ways:\nShoot the Pilot, causing the Dargyn to float gracefully to the ground for you to board:\n \nUse Loki’s Switch Teleport on the Pilot, leaving him grounded and confused:\n \nUse a finisher from behind while using Archwing, allowing you to transition from Archwing to Dargyn:\nIn addition to this new mechanic, we have also made the following changes:\nIncreased mounted Dargyn projectile damage from 250 to 450 and increased the clip size from 50 to 75. \nIncreased the spawn frequency of Dargyn patrol and idle Dargyn encounters when roaming the Plains.\n\nImproved Defense Target navigation by shifting the path towards the center of level.\nBuilt additional buildings around the Defense Target path at both Defense locations.\nAdded additional enemy spawn locations for each Defense location, giving AI more of 360 degree attack option.\nAdjusted Turrets within the level.\nAdded additional cover and attack routes for AI.\nThe rail upon which the Defense Tram travels on is now electrified!\nMoved hack panels to easier-to-find places in certain Grineer Shipyard tilesets. Hopefully you won’t get caught in a lockdown, but if you do, it should be faster to find a panel!\nWe now show you what camera is being highlighted in Advanced Mode.\nAdded tool-tips to help you know what's going on with the settings! \nCaptura, Text, now, supports, commas,!\nImproved speed multiplier controls for controllers.\nFixed 'Cinematic Mode' button not re-appearing when swapping settings.\n\n\nThe improvements to Khora keep on coming! We have a number of important fixes that really help with making Khora play better, as well as some changes!\nChanges include:\n\nIncreased the range of Ensnare.\nRemoved the Line of Sight check from Ensnare to make it more reliable. \nRange Mods now affect Whipclaw's AoE radius, but it is capped. \nKhora's Whipclaw can now damage decorations (crates, barrels, etc).\nKhora's Kavat now teleports to a given target instead of pathing there if the target is too far away!\nChanged Khora’s Venari animations from domestic Kavat to Feral Kavat. \nAdjusted a number of Syandanas to fit Khora better.\nTweaked Venari command sounds.\nFixes include:\n\nFixed a weird 'foot shuffle' animation with Whipclaw. \nFixed using Khora’s Whipclaw on a target causing all enemies affected by Ensnare to be released when the target is killed while ensnared. This one was particularly nasty in practice and made her kit feel weak! \nFixed Khora’s Venari getting locked in her Attack Mode when attempting Mastery Rank tests, which can cause failure on stealth tests (MR9 for example). \nFixed infinite re-whipping for Khora's Whipclaw by flailing the camera around rapidly. \nFixed Ospreys not being fully disabled by Khora’s Ensnare.\nFixed Venari freezing in place when entering Cetus from the Plains, and subsequently duplicating if you head back out, eventually leading to a hall of kitty statues.\nReduced explosion radius from 6m to 4m .\nLowered the Tusk Bombard’s base health from 350 to 300.\nFixed smoke trail behind rocket to persist for life of projectile (trail was disappearing after 8s of flight time, making it very hard to see the rocket).\nReduced explosion radius from 10m to 4m.\nReduced lifetime of fire explosion FX from 10s to 7s.\nAdded a damage element to those fire FX \nMinor Heat damage and Heat proc if touched.\nFixed flame trail behind rocket to persist for life of projectile (trail was disappearing after 5s of flight time, making it very hard to see the Napalm).\nMelee attacks (including spin attacks) will no longer sweep through walls or objects. Please read our Dev Workshop for Melee insight!\nNumerous weapons have received the PBR treatment: \nFlux Rifle (original material and the Shock Camo Skin)\nLanka (original material and the Shock Camo Skin)\nGram\nKraken\nMarelok\nGrinlok\nKronen\nKarak\nTwin Gremlins\nBrakk\nSeer \nhas also receive a new scope FX!\nThe Ceramic Dagger has received a new look! Previously it was identical to the Cronus.\nMade nearly 10,000 micro-optimizations to hundreds of scripts including Warframe Powers, Precepts, Enemy Logic, Weapon Behaviors, Game-Modes, and the UI.\nHarrow’s Condemn, Thurible, and Gara’s Shattered Lash (stab) can now be used on ziplines. \nGara’s Splinter Storm now applies a HUD buff when cast on self to help manage when casting on many targets. \nOperators now emit pain grunts when experiencing fall damage.\nEidolon Lures will wait until the Eidolon has fully disappeared to be auto-destroyed, instead of being auto-destroyed when the sun rises at dawn.\nRemoved the ‘Related Items’ tab from Syndicate Offerings because of purchase attempts resulting in script errors. \nOpened even more previously locked treasure walls in the Void!\nYou now spawn in the Observatory upon returning to the Dojo after a mission.\nIncreased door opening speeds on the Grineer Settlement and Grineer Galleon Tilesets. \nPolished the animations of the Steel Meridian and Cephalon Suda Syndicate handshake emotes. \nReduced the frequency of large Grineer Settlement tiles appearing in Extermination missions to help them feel a little less long.\nRemoved legacy loot crates from Void Onslaught tiles that should not have been part of Simaris' simulation.\nIncreased time given by targets in the Round 11 Mastery Rank Test from 3.5 seconds to 5 seconds and added aim assist to targets to make them slightly easier to hit. \nTurned down volume of bullet impacts on player’s Flesh and Shields.\nChanged the “Dead End” message that appears when viewing a Dojo expansion doorway upon hitting the room limit to say “Maximum Room Count Reached”.\nCrouching is now stateful! If you let go of crouch while in a small tunnel, your Warframe will now stand up when it can.You can also now  crouch while parrying.\nUpdated the ambience in the Simulacrum by removing the repeating music loops.\nRevised and improved several Rock and Cave materials and meshes. \nQuality of life changes for Grineer cell doors in Rescue missions.\nChanged the marker on the panel used to move the tram in one of the Grineer Asteroid tiles to use a different icon so it can’t be confused with the main yellow diamond objective marker. \nDisabled Challenges in some quest missions (e.g. “use your first power 5 times”).\nSeveral Corpus Rescue mission Co-Op door improvements and fixes:\nChanged default state to locked where doors were closed to fix spawning issues.\nReplaced markers with new type.\nAdded state icons to all doors.\nAdded a new marker type on panels for consistency.\nAdded activation sound to door context actions.\nAligned door hint with the ground and changed widths to fit doors (some were too wide).\nRemoved panels from opposite side of the door since they're never accessible.\nShortened delay before the door opens when panels are activated.\nFixed context action alignment.\nFixed missing shiny 'destroy' material on consoles.\nFixed door closing after being opened.\nFixed materials on tram door so it doesn't look like a dead end.\nFixed some broken material script properties.\nPolished Harrow’s Idle animations and his Agile/Noble Speargun variant animations. \nUpdated several ability stat descriptors to make them clearer:\nStandardized format across all Warframe ability descriptions.\nE.g. Range (Meters) #  to Range #\nE.g. “Health over Time #” to “Health / Sec #”\nAdded units of measurement to the abilities where appropriate \nM (meters), S (seconds), % (percentage), X (multiplier), etc. \nConverted decimals to whole numbers (e.g. Equinox’s Rest & Rage Wakeup Health Threshold has been changed from 0.5 to 50% for max rank). \nChanged “Range” to “Radius” for several Warframe abilities.\nSyndicate Pickups are now auto-marked on the first pickup! \nRemoved erroneous stats from Sentinel UI (Energy and Sprint Speed).\nLotus is less chatty in Fissure missions! \nShortened and simplified most levels for the Vor's Prize missions, making sure the missions are more suitable for new player navigation. \nAdjusted the Mithra Syandana based on feedback. \nArcane ranks are now on the side of the icon rather than in the 'name' field.\nYou can now purchase multiple copies of Arcane Blueprints in Hok and Quills Offerings.\nIncreased the in-mission volume of Octavia's Horos Sound Pack by .5dB. \nTweaked the Nova Lamia Skin to better match the Steam Workshop images.\nTweaked the Skeiron Zephyr Skin to be more shiny and metallic instead of matte.\nTweaked the emissives of the Excalibur Sentient Slayer Skin.\nTweaked the Maltzur Oculus List Skin to improve the emissive details.\nUpdated naming filter to allow players to use appropriate words that contain inappropriate words, like “assassin”.\nUpdated chat profanity filter to catch profanity with punctuation immediately following it.

  "changes": "Beasts Of The Sanctuary: Update 22.18.0:\n\nIt’s the postponed Christmas gift that keeps on giving! Revealed back on November 3rd 2017, Khora has finally clawed her way to your screens. From an originally proposed damage deviator to the now metallic Kavat wielding queen of the Strangledome, her time is now. But, she won’t come easily. For Khora and Venari have been detected in Simaris’ Sanctuary, and it’s his rules that are law there.\n\nA balanced Zaw Strike for Nikana and Staff weapons. A steady blade for steady hands.\nA heavy Zaw Strike for Machete and Hammer weapons. Measure twice, strike once... heavily.\nA light Zaw Strike for Scythe or Hammer weapons. Lightweight, for flash and bite.\nA two-handed Zaw Grip for measured strikes and greater impact.\nA one-handed Zaw Grip for measured strikes and greater impact.\nIn the simulated universe of the Sanctuary, my data-immortals have fought each other countless times. Through this violence, I have studied and documented their true character. But my study cannot be complete without the power of the Tenno, the most powerful specimen in the system  — you. Your duty in this experiment is to kill as many specimens as efficiently as possible. In this chaos, the true nature of these creatures will be revealed... as will yours.”\nMust complete The New Strange quest.\nTalk to Cephalon Simaris at his Sanctuary in any Relay OR select Sanctuary Onslaught in the Syndicate World State Window tab.\nEnter the Conduit to the Sanctuary and maintain Efficiency against increasingly difficult Specimens for 2.5 minutes.\nEach Specimen you kill attributes to your overall Efficiency, with Eximus Specimens attributing more. \nEfficiency Stimulus’ are spawned per zone that each grant 10% Efficiency \nuse them wisely!\nEach zone after the first triggers a 45 second Focus Boost that scales in multiplier (MAX of 16x) \nkill Specimens as fast as you can!\nWhen a zone is complete, Simaris will open a Data-Conduit to a new and harder zone within his Sanctuary.\nEach week Simaris simulates a predetermined sequence of tilesets and Elite Specimens. This Onslaught is not for the leisurely, as Specimens are stronger and Simaris’ rewards for your Elite data mimic your efforts. Fight relentlessly and repeatedly until your fingers bleed \nthis please Simaris.\nNo Gear! The Gear wheel, Specters, and Emotes are disabled in Sanctuary Onslaught and Elite. Strictly no Dancing in Simaris' world. \nSimaris demands only Rank 30 Warframes can compete in the Sanctuary.\nAn overuse of Warframe abilities can skew Simaris’ data. You may find he has different tolerance levels against ultimates than first abilities. You may never even encounter this rule, but if you do, know that it is only temporary. \nEach Conduit entered/Zone advanced removes current buffs, active Warframe abilities, combo multipliers, and resets Energy to the respective base level. Harder enemies from a baseline! \nThe amount of Efficiency Stimulus that spawn decreases the deeper you go into the Sanctuary. Simaris is (somewhat) kind and will always spawn at least 1.\nIncrease your pace! The deeper you go into the Sanctuary the faster your Efficiency drops. \nSpecimens do not drop real-world things like Mods/Resources in Simaris’ Sanctuary. Rewards certainly do exist, though. Focus Boons and Reward Tables (below) aplenty! We are also going to introduce a series of rewards once this launch is out \nthere will be more to come!\nLeaderboards are available based on overall score for both Sanctuary Onslaught and Elite Sanctuary Onslaught that Simaris will reset weekly.\n2 Zones = Rotation A\n4 Zones = Rotation A\n6 Zones = Rotation B\n8 Zones = Rotation C\nRemoved Excalibur’s 3 second cooldown on Radial Blind.\nRemoved Weekly Kills Leaderboards and Leaderboard Top 20 placement notification.

  "changes": "Shrine Of The Eidolon: Update 22.16.0:\nFirst, it's worth mentioning this is largely rooted in improved functionality across the board. We do plan on releasing even more updates soon with further lighting improvements and the 'Build your Own Obstacle Course', so keep checking back for that.\nAnd now, the Remaster!\nWith this Remaster we've aimed to do a few things:\nGive you better decorating tools.\nOffer you more decorations.\nGive you more functionality in the Dojo.\n*Please note that the following items cannot be contributed to the Clan Vault:\nAll Articulas, Displays, and unique items (Neewa's Drawings, etc)\nAmbulas Noggle\nStalker Noggle\nShadow Debt Noggles (Acolytes)\nKuria Statuette\nSacred Vessel\nOro Ornament\nRell’s Donda\nProminence Wisp Totem\nThousand-Year Fish Statuette\nAyatan Sculptures \nwe know many of you enjoy creating monstrous creatures out of Ayatan, but we want to prevent any Endo tears from accidental non-refundable donations. Once everyone familiarizes themselves with this new 'Decorations in the Vault are permanent' we'll loosen this restriction.\nMission type and difficulty level\nPlanet and node\nOpen spots in your squad\nA whole new setting called Controller Interface now allows you to have the option of AutoDetect! AutoDetect will try to detect what you're using, when you use it. So if you prefer the drag-n-drop functionality of the Mods screen, you can keep using a mouse to do that and see the regular keyboard and mouse UI, however, when you next pick up a controller and press a button, the UI will detect that and refresh to show you controller button Icons instead.\nWithin the Controller Interface you can also permanently toggle on/off the controller interface, which forces the UI into either regular (keyboard and mouse) mode, or controller mode (this works separately from auto-detection and Steam Big Picture mode).\nLastly, you can now choose the UI Icon set under the new setting Controller Icon Set. You can choose between XB1, XB 360, PS4, Steam, and AutoDetect (AutoDetect is essentially XB1). However, using a Steam controller will always result in Steam Icons.\nImproved how precisely you can alter the Camera Duration slider (increment by 0.1 when using the arrow buttons next to the slider). This means that the minimum speed for Camera movements is now lower!\nImproved optimization of Advanced Captura Mode.\nThe playing Camera will now stop if you decide to edit a Camera Position while it's playing.\nImprovements for adding/removing Camera Positions while camera is playing in Captura.\nBrilliant/Radiant Shards are not removed from player inventory until the respective Eidolon spawns.\nPlayers can now remove their Shard after inserting it into the Shrine (until the Eidolon spawns, at which point it is removed from their inventories and consumed by the Shrine).\nAll Shards are removed from the Shrine and returned to Player inventories if a Host migration occurs before the Eidolon spawns.\nAll Shards are removed from the Shrine and returned to Player inventories if Night ends before the respective Eidolon spawns.\nAll Shards are removed from the Shrine and returned to Player inventories if players extract from that Plains before the Eidolon spawns.\nVomvalysts no longer drop Sentient Cores when they are auto-'killed' at sunrise. Unlike vampires, Vomvalysts are not killed by the sun, they just “go back to where they came from”.\nBased on feedback we are making some changes to the intensity of Visual Effects in Warframe, especially in the context of Eidolon fights!\n\nReduced some visual noise/lens flares on numerous Warframe abilities.\nReduced some visual noise/lens flares on the Operator Amp explosions/melee burst.\nGreatly toned down lens flare brightness and durations of Teralyst abilities (and variants)to help with visual clutter.\nImproved handling of rare cases of cache-corruption that would lead to crashes on startup.\nImproved hitbox sizes on the Eidolon Synovias (weak points) to make them easier to hit/target when moving.\nFixed an extra \"0\" damage number popping up for every instance of damage dealt to a Teralyst Synovia. Shotguns will therefore no longer shower the Teralyst with a confetti of zeroes when hitting a weak-point.\nBoltor Prime Status Chance increased from 32% to 34%.\nThe Shard selection screen will now show you how many Brilliant or Radiant Shards you have available to convert into Focus (originally this number would only be available to you once you had selected what Shard type you wanted to convert).\nSpoiler\nOpened arbitrarily locked Void doors/walls that held Rare items. It’s been known for awhile now that the classic combination of Punch Through + Vacuum could grab these items for you, but now it’s open season for all!\nReduced the requirements for \"Kill X Dargyns with a Bow\" Riven challenge to bring the intended difficulty and time commitment in line with other Riven challenges.\nExisting Rivens with this challenge are unaffected\nFish Bait descriptions now also indicate what time of day that the respective fish will spawn. \nSlightly changed the color of each Fishing Spear to better identify which Spear you’re equipping.\nChanged the Fishing Spear Icons in Fisher Hai-Luk’s store to focus more on the Spear tip to better identify each Spear. \nYou can now search for Zaws in your Inventory via their Entitled name.\nUpdated the look of Nekros’ Shadows of the Dead minions to help players better differentiate between them and real enemies.\nUpdated the Verismo Syandana and Boltor Bravura Skin material to appear more metallic (for improved reflections and highlighting) to better match the Octavia Maestra Skin. \nA special UI message is now displayed when picking up a Syndicate Medallion or Cetus Wisp (similar to Argon Crystal). \nYou can now re-open the Ambulas boss doors from the outside if you’re an unlucky Tenno who got locked out of the arena cause your squad initiated the boss fight without you.\nImproved Archwing camera movements to clean up issues of janky jittering. \nRemoved the option to Install a Focus Lens on a Gilded Amp since a Rank 30 Amp is required for that action.\nChanged the Venomous Clip Archwing Mod to reflect the same Cost and Drain of other elemental Mods for Archwing.\nRemoved UI Buff indicators for Focus passives that are active 100% of the time with the exception of Vazarin’s Mending Soul. \nUpdated LOC for the \"Vigilante Fervor\" description to better describe what it does. \nAyatans (with the same type and socket layout) placed as Orbiter Decorations can now be placed back to back as per: https://twitter.com/PabloPoon/status/966762954338250752 \nInfested Ancients will now attempt to attack in more ways than just knockdowns and pulls when you’re within melee range. \nFailed Bounty squads will now be locked to prevent players from joining an already failed Bounty.\nImproved Sky Archwing banking movements to reduce doing so accidentally.\nYou can now shoot while initiating Afterburner in Sky Archwing. \nPlacing in the top 20 in a weekly Leaderboard with at least 50 entries will now show a notification about your placement!\nSentinels and their weapons will now display stats when Chat linked and viewed in the Codex.\nTennoGen items are now linkable in chat! \nNezha Dracun Skin default tints updated to lighten the dark tint and better match workshop images.\nTweaked the Mithra Mirage Skin colors to better reflect the Steam Workshop images.\nUpdated the Sarva Harness textures by request of the creator.\nIncreased the opening speed of doors in the Grineer Sealab tileset. \nRemoved the ability to purchase multiple of the same Helmet/Syandana from the Market. With the changes to how Arcanes are equipped, buying multiple of the same Helmet/Syandana is not necessary. \nUpdated the Vignette Bundle description to indicate it includes 2 Warframe Articulas.\nThe Market previews will now display your current equipped Warframe/Sentinel when viewing Armor Bundles. \nOperator Amps will now display their modular parts in the Operator Customization screen.\nImproved AI navigation in the Grineer Settlement tileset. \nImproved AI navigation in the Grineer Sealab Defense tileset.\nImproved AI navigation in the Grineer Galleon Survival tileset.\nImproved AI navigation in the Corpus Ice Planet Defense tileset.\nImproved AI navigation  in the Corpus Outpost Rescue tileset.\nImproved AI navigation and cover techniques in the Lua Defense tileset.\nUpdated all lowercase mentions of ‘Grineer’, ‘Corpus’ and ‘Warframe’ to be uniformly uppercase across the entire game in all languages.\nUpdated the Elite Frontier Lancer Codex image model.\nTweaked the glow FX on the Verismo Syandana. \nIncreased the number of items shown on the ‘Most Used’ list under your Profile & added the ability to scroll the list using your mouse. \nMade slight edits to the Mastery Rank up description so that it reads better.\nIncreased textbox width for Arcane text in Arcane Manager screen.\n",

The Trials lobby is no longer needed!\nIf you need an Arcane refresher, this spoiler is for you!\n\nUpon logging in, all Arcanes installed on Cosmetics/Helmets will be Distilled because Arcanes can no longer be installed on Cosmetics/Helmets.\nOld Legacy Arcane Helmets will keep their Arcane installed but you can not equip the Legacy Arcane Helmet on a Warframe with 2 Arcanes already installed.\nArcanes can only be installed on your Warframe, Operator, Operator Amp, or Zaw.\nYou can install 2 Arcanes per Warframe and per Operator.\nYou can install 1 Arcane on Operator Amps and Zaws.\nYou can now trade Upgraded Arcanes!\nArcanes have received a visual overhaul! Arcane Rarity now matches the style we use on Mods and Relics. Hopefully this is a much clearer representation of their Rarity than before: \nYou can now search/sort within the Arcane Manager screen.\nYou must be at least Mastery Rank 5 or have an Arcane owned if below Mastery Rank 5 to install an Arcane.\nFixed Beam weapons not being able to damage enemies (alive but in a ragdolled state) when being affected by certain ‘crowd control’ Abilities.\nDamage now ramps up over 0.6 seconds and after moving off target there is a delay of 0.8 seconds before it starts to decay over 2 seconds.\nAll Beam weapons now start their Damage ramp up at 20% (instead of 10%) with the following exceptions:\nConvectrix\nPrimary fire starts at 60%.\nAlt fire starts at 80%.\nPhage\nStarts at 70%.\nEmbolist\nStarts at 30%.\nThe Multishot chance should now apply more consistently with Beam weapons.\nWeapon Range Mods (like Sinister Reach) no longer affect the distance of chains for chainable Beam weapons (like the Amprex). Main Beam distance is still affected by them.\nFixed Beam weapons continuously firing when quick Meleeing.\nChain Range increased from 7.5m to 10m.\nDamage reduced from 24 to 22.\nRange increased from 20m to 24m.\nMag size decreased from 60 to 40.\nChain Range increased from 4m to 7m.\nIncreased Range from 20m to 27m.\nIncreased Damage from 18 to 20.\nTweaked Flux Rifle controller rumble on recharge.\nEndless Excavation missions now display ‘Digs Completed’ instead of ‘Total Cryotic Excavated’. The number of ‘Digs Completed’ is what counts towards the tiered Rewards in the Endless modes, and this change saves you some mental math! \nYou can still see the total Cryotic Excavated on the Mission Progress screen.\nUpon mounting a Dargyn, your Warframe will now become ‘invincible’ and enemies will attempt to destroy the Dargyn first instead of you.\nRemoved the ability to mount a Dargyn during Transference. Although this resulted in an amazing bug where a Warframe would fly away in the Dargyn and do work while you watched from your Operator on the ground, it’s not intended! \nRemoved dust FX on idling Dargyns.\nFixed not exiting Archwing mode when mounting and dismounting a Dargyn when Archwing is active.\nFixed being unable to place a waypoint when driving a Dargyn. \nFixed exiting a Dargyn

Bounties.\nFixed enemies spawning on the wrong side of the portal in the final stage of The New Strange quest.\nFixed Mesa's Ballistic Battery ability's interaction with Beam weapons to behave like other weapon types: the Damage bonus is now only applied to one Damage hit, but it is not affected by the Beam weapon ramp-up and always applies full Damage.\nFixed Atlas’ Rubble not having any physics, which resulted in Rubble floating in the air if that Petrified enemy died there.\nFixed Ash’s Shuriken applying numerous Slash Status Effects to every enemy (even ones not hit) if in a group together (using Ferrox’s Alt Fire to group enemies closely). \nFixed Zephyr's Tornados remaining indefinitely if player goes into a bleedout and then self Revives.\nFixed markers for Lures and player

  "changes": "Shrine Of The Eidolon: Hotfix 22.13.3:\nBeam Weapon behavior was originally changed to help with performance but as we've made optimizations to the game over time, we can return them to their original status of hitscan weapons with pinpoint accuracy and zero recoil. Or at least we think we can.\nPerfect accuracy and high fire rate is balanced by limited range and damage ramping up from 10% to 100% over 0.8 seconds when firing and decays back to 10% over 1 second after stopping. To help with ammo economy, Beam Weapons consume 0.5 ammo per trace \nunless they are Flamethrowers.\nOnce this launches (hopefully this week on PC), we're hoping for some practical feedback on the changes and your thoughts! It's a bit tricky to grasp the behaviour changes on paper, but in practice it's something you'll be able to detect quickly. Please bear that in mind when replying \npractical feedback will be the needle mover for any tweaks to come.\nWith such a huge change in behavior, comparing new stats with old is like apples to oranges so they are presented on their own below from our designer:\nBeam weapons now state \"STATUS\" instead of \"STATUS / SEC\" in the Arsenal because they can now Status Effect more than once per second (like all other weapons).\nThe Flux Rifle has a new battery charge up and fully charged sound to go with it’s beam rework!\nMinor tweaks to reload timing on Glaxion and Gammacor.\nTweaked the Synapse beam to better represent it’s Corrosive Damage.\nCurrently Multishot Mods do not increase Status chance. Multishot works like all other weapons except the affect is in the same spot as the base occurrence. We are monitoring this closely!\nCernos Prime Alt Fire is now silent as intended.\nIncreased the Fire Rate of the Zenith's Alt Fire.\nMade the additional projectiles of Talons and Castanas from Multishot spread in a more uniform/predictable pattern.\nEnabled weapon hit notifications for all projectile based weapons. A visual and audible example can be seen here from Devstream #106: https://clips.twitch.tv/GrotesqueElatedStingrayMcaT\nMap can now be panned halfway off screen\nWhen opening Advanced Map, the player position will be centered on the screen\nThe controller reticle will no longer be movable, instead the right analog stick will pan the Map around\nLeft analog stick now controls Map zoom\nPanning leeway will now scale with zoom level (so the Map can't be dragged far beyond the panning limit when zoomed in too much)\nIncreased the Endo awarded by Simaris’ Daily Synthesis Target by 2x.\nHold-to-Charge Abilities (Ember’s Fireball, Zephyr’s Tail Wind, etc) no longer auto cast when full. Cast now occurs on Charge release.\nAlso, if Energy drops below Charge cost, it will auto cast at the appropriate Charge level.\nCritical Chance, Critical Multiple, and Status Effect Chance now all apply to enemies inside Zephyr’s Tornado.\nLowered particle burst, opacity and particle count on numerous Gantulyst and Hydrolyst abilities in an attempt to alleviate performance issues and reduce visual clutter.\nLowered particle burst for Vomvalyst charge up attacks to alleviate performance issues.\nTweaked Kavat wall attack behaviours to prevent ‘supercat’. \nAdarza Kavat’s Cat’s Eye Critical Chance Buff no longer apply to Operators.\nSmeeta Kavat’s Charm Critical Chance and Energy recharge Buffs no longer apply to Operators.\nUpdated description of the Mod \"Entropy Burst\" to read \"Base Status Chance\" instead of \"Status Chance\".\nPicking up a Syndicate Medallion, Exceptional Sentient Core, or Flawless Sentient Core will now display the same special UI message like when you pick up an Argon Crystal.\nTalking to Onkko will now make all other Operators invisible, just like when you talk to Konzu with a busy crowd closeby. \nWhen customizing your Warframe under the Appearance tab, your Warframe will appear unarmed and idling to make customization easier without going into a blocking/armed stance. \nThe message that appears when you are over the Riven capacity limit will now have options to open the Dissolve screen, purchase Slots, or defer to later instead of having to go into the Dissolve screen first.\nCorrected a texture on the Repala Syandana to make it fully opaque instead of slightly transparent.\nTweaked the Saryn Nita’s Moda Skin to have a more pronounced ‘pulsating’ effect as requested by the creator.\nIgnis and Ignis Wraith are now usable in Conclave.\nFixed players not seeing the ‘killfeed’ when a player has been killed in Conclave.\nFixed not being able to equip the Knightess and Corpra Helmets in Conclave.\n",

  "changes": "Shrine Of The Eidolon: Update 22.12.0yup, Another Mainline!:\nTake your fight to the skies by hijacking unmanned Dargyns in the Plains. If you get caught, it's a footrace against the pilot to board the Dargyn! Use these to aid in your search for the new Eidolons!\n\n\n\n“The Sentient was a deformed creature, sent from some dark fold of distant space, crushing towers and citadels across Earth...”\nUntil meeting its fate in a climactic battle.\n“The device detonated. The Sentient's body shuddered, wracked by a cacophonous energy. Fragments of the Sentient crashed to the Plains and marshes and flatlands...”\nThese fragments are known as the Eidolons -\nmysterious titans that continue to wander the Plains and loom over the people of Cetus.\nMost of you have seen the Teralyst, a beast that rises from the watery depths every night. Legends speak of two more Eidolons that fell to the Plains, dormant for centuries but ever-present in the hearts and minds of the Ostrons.\nEidolon Hunters eager to prove their worth are trying to summon these creatures again. Are you worthy, Tenno?\n\nLegends say the Gantulyst wields an enormous boulder for an arm and radiates powerful beams of Sentient energy. The Ostrons built a shrine in its honor hoping to gain its favor.\n\nThe Ostrons believe the Hydrolyst is an omen of impending natural disaster. Stories describe a distinct, pungent aroma that precedes the arrival of this toxic beast.\n\n\nYou now have options to matchmake for Eidolon Hunts!\nIf you’re worthy, you’ll receive a guaranteed Riven Transmuter from the Hydrolyst (if captured). These consumable items can Transmute four Riven Mods into a brand-new Riven. Combining four Rivens of the same type (i.e Rifle, Melee, Shotgun, etc.) will result in a transmuted Riven of that type.\n\n\nEach Warframe’s stats and ability kits combine into a unique entity that offers different strengths and weaknesses. With 34 Warframes to choose from (and the 35th on the way), a Tenno may find there is no challenge they cannot overcome by making good use of the swiss army knife that their Arsenal offers. Some well-rounded frames do multiple things well, while others greatly excel in specific circumstances.\nWhen reviewing the Arsenal over time, our developers often find themselves asking: 'is this fun?’. That's the most important question to us, from the perspective of both the active player and their three squadmates. We understand the importance of power fantasy, but overbearing abilities can make squadmates feel ineffective by seriously disrupting intended gameplay flow. Conversely, when a Warframe doesn’t do enough, players may simply choose a “better” frame, sacrificing personalization and diversity for efficiency. Neither of these situations are ideal, so let’s shake things up!\nIf you've read the Dev Workshop, a lot of this will look familiar, but there are some minor changes! Our intent remains the same. We relist important information here because our Update notes are much more widely read than Dev Workshops.\nWe are revisiting all weapons and adjusting their stats to fit into some Mastery Rank grouping guidelines based on DPS and Crit/Status split total. With this in mind, we are buffing a lot of the weapons you know and love!\nAgain, a lot of this is as shown in the Dev Workshop, but our Update Notes are more widely read.\n\nSadly, not noted here are BEAM weapons \nthey should be ready soon, but we are revisiting them to be more 'like they used to be' in terms of damage instances over time but with a fixed fire rate. Fire Rate mods and their effects are still being determined. The Beam Weapon Category is simply not ready for this Update, but we are still working on it!\n\nConclave Weapon damage rebalancing has been done separately to account for the changes.\n\nWe calculate DPS based on sustained DPS which also takes Critical and Status values into account so our values may be different than yours!\n\nFor those of you in the Riven Market, please be aware these stats will not affect Riven dispositions. Player popularity / usage stats will continue to be the metric for that.\n\nOur data shows enemy weapons are unaffected by this, but if there are cases you believe to be wrong please note them in an appropriate subforum.\nWe sketched out Mastery Rank groupings of 0-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12 and 13-15 for each weapon type with a minimum DPS and amount split between crit and status for each group. Using existing stats, weapons were sorted into the groups. If their stats were too high for their current MR it was raised along with any other properties to match.\nIt's damage places it in MR 10-12 but it's crit and stat split is way too low. MR, status and critical chance is increased to match it's new MR. Increasing status and critical boosts its damage so its reduced down to fit back into the MR group guidelines its original stats dictated\nThe end result is the high performing/popular weapons stats remain untouched outside of being placed into their intended MR group and the rest of the weapons are brought up to equivalency.\n\nProjectile based and low fire rate weapons were given more crit and status allowance when appropriate.\n\nFree weapons like the Dex series have been given Mastery Rank values to match their stats! We know these are grandfathered in inventory regardless of Mastery Rank, it's just for consistency!\n\nSome outliers exist that either don’t meet or exceed their Mastery Rank's allotted DPS and \nCrit/Status split allowance because of additional properties and/or features.\nGrakata \nexceeds Crit/Status split but is extremely inaccurate\nStrun Wraith \nDPS is lower than  its Mastery Rank group but it has forced stagger on hit and high status chance\n\nIf players continue, they earn the credits reward, and the wager target is reset so that they have the opportunity to reach it again for more rewards. If players extract, the game ends and they collect all the rewards they managed to earn. The initial investment fee is only taken away once, regardless of the number of times the reward was earned. If time runs out and players are losing, they forfeit all rewards.\nRequired points per tier are now 50/75/100.\nIncreased the required Index points from 25/50/100 to 50/100/200\nEnemy levels scale half as fast.\nChanged the investment costs from 45k/60k/75k to 30k/40k/50k, and changed the credit returns from 120k/195k/275k to 105k/175k/250k. The amount of profit for each tier remains the same at 75k/135k/200k.\nChanged the rewards to give the total credit return and take away invested credits, instead of combining them into the net profit.\nIncreased Teralyst base level to 50.\nReduced base Armor and reduced base Health of Synovia weak points a bit.\nReduced damage of Teralyst abilities to reflect increased level.\nInverted the Shuffle state to be bright when it's enabled, and dark when disabled.\nResource Drop Chance Boosters now affect Mining and Fishing, doubling the chance to get gems and the base number of fish spawns! (Previously only regular Resource Boosters affected the Plains)\nPrime Vault Bounty Relics in Stage 1 have been moved to be rewarded in Stage 2 and weighted accordingly amongst the other Stages. It’s worth noting that Bounty Stage 5 now yields the highest chance of getting a Vaulted Relic. Our intentions here are to alleviate players abandoning the Bounty after the first Stage.\nResource Theft Incursion and Bounty stage (aka Armored Vault) in Plains now lasts only 2 minutes (was 3 minutes).\nIncreased amount of Lures allowed at once from 6 to 8. Lures that have not been hacked to Tenno faction now get destroyed when their camp is deactivated, freeing up room for a new Lure to spawn when players enter other camps.\nReplaced Relics rewarded from Ghouls with Prime Vault Relics (Lith G2 & Neo E1 replaced Lith T1 & Neo S7).\nFocus Passives now apply immediately upon loading into a mission rather than requiring the brief Operator transition.\nOperators can now interact with Pets on your Orbiter!\nReduced the delay between using a Gear item and spawning Archwing in the Plains.\nZaws and Operator Amps now have a stat in your Profile.\nMastery Rank eligible weapons now appear first with locked weapons appearing below when viewing weapons in the Market and Arsenal.\nPressing and holding the fire button on an automatic weapon during a dodge roll will now begin firing once the dodge roll is complete. It's now consistent with pressing and holding the fire button before doing the dodge roll.\nInterrupting an automatic weapon with quick melee will no longer require the player to press the trigger again; the weapon will now resume firing once the melee attack is done.\nUpdated the Dojo Research completion icon.\nTweaked Dojo Tenno Lab glass to fix bloom issues when using custom Dojo colors.\nWarframes in the Tenno Lab will now spin instead of standing still \nso fancy!\nImproved the coordination of rain and stormy skies in the Plains to fix rain appearing during a clear blue sky.\nReduced head bounce movement in Chroma’s sprint turns.\nForma/Forma Bundle prices in the Arsenal Upgrade screen will now display the discounted price if there's an active sale.\nRelay Chat tab now goes to the right of the squad tab.\nEidolon Vomvalyst Lures now have a new distinctive mesh!\nUpdated mastered icons in Inventory, they are now using the teal version rather than plain white.\nMastered icons now also appear on Blueprints in the Inventory for items that have been mastered.\nUpdated Grineer Settlement icon when used in the World State Window (old one was just a distant screencap of Phobos).\nLowered and reduced marker range for small elevators in Grineer Asteroid tiles.\nPurchasing a Slot or Orokin Catalyst in the Upgrade screen will now auto equip/install. This reduces the amount of prompts you have to go through to equip/install said items.\nHarrow’s emissives will now always be on so you don’t need Penance active to see Energy Colors.\nChroma can no longer jump or sprint when using Spectral Scream.\n\n",

But in the wake of Prime Vault Relics being put into Bounties there are vocal issues that we wanted to address before we’re heads down until this update ships on PC.\nAlso, if you didn’t see we posted another Dev Workshop on the upcoming Warframe Revisited changes:\n\nTweaked the Bounty reward rotations to eliminate patterns of repeated rewards.\nFor clarification: This change does not affect what rewards you can get in a given Bounty run. This change made it so that we make sure you see all 3 reward rotations of those in a given 7.5 hour span (since each day is 2.5 hours).\n",

  "changes": "Plains Of Eidolon: Hotfix 22.11.1:\n\nManipulate, incinerate and shatter your enemies with this Prime Vault Unsealed. The Prime Vault is open now on all platforms and brings back Loki Prime, Ember Prime and Frost Prime for a limited time. Returning with them are other high-demand Vaulted Prime Accessories and Weapons along with discounted Platinum in four unique packs: the Loki & Ember Dual Prime Pack, the Loki Deception Prime Pack, the Ember Fire Prime Pack, and the Frost Ice Prime Pack: https://www.warframe.com/prime-vault\nEmber Prime, Frost Prime, Loki Prime, Wyrm Prime, Bo Prime, Sicarus Prime, Glaive Prime, Latron Prime, and Reaper Prime Relics have been added as Cetus Bounty rewards for a limited time. You can also find these limited Vaulted Relics in Relic Packs from the Market or as Syndicate rewards.\nThe new Relics are:\nLith G2\nMeso E1\nMeso F3\nNeo F1\nNeo E1\nAxi L1\nAxi S2\nWhy Bounties?\nWe put these Relics in the Bounties not only to change it up, but to also allow for extremely focused Relic acquisition. By having these Relics concentrated in the Bounties, it also leaves the rest of the Star Chart open for placement of new Relics when the next Prime Access begins so you'll have a change of environment while keeping with the same system: hunting Primes.\nRemember, this is a 2 month unvaulting, which means these Relics have 2 months to be acquired. In that time, we will be closely monitoring how reproducible Performance issues may factor into this round and possibly revisit Relic placement. We do want to keep it the same on all Platforms so we'll need a bit of time to make changes.\nAll Bounties reward rotations from tiers 2 to 5 have a Vaulted Relic in it, and be sure to check our droprates site for the latest!\nUpdated textures to the Trinity Knightess Skin at the creator's request.\nImproved the lighting in the Market diorama.\nFollowers (Specters, Rescue Target, etc) no longer cancel charging if they switch targets while using a charging weapon.\n",

This is to give players a better indication of how much shields it has left. \nWe now present players with the option to buy a Forma Bundle when using the Upgrade screen to install Forma. \nAdded filters to the Fish inventory screen at Fisher Hai-Luk's shop (Small, Medium, Large).\nAdded distinct icons for Elevator controls going up or down and increased the speed of some Elevators. \nYou can now decide to only allow friend invites from certain groups (All, Friends of Friends, etc). \nYou can now see how many of a given Mod you own if you click it through Chat Linking!\nAdded Time of Day text to the Free Roam node for the Plains of Eidolon!\nAdded Replay Quest option for A Man of Few Words. \nAdded Replay Quest option for Stolen Dreams. \nAdded a small delay when transitioning to jog from run after firing a weapon so you have time to play your fire animation.

  "changes": "Plains Of Eidolon: Update 22.10.0:\nDisclaimer:\nTenno! This Update brings you yet another Mainline! You may recall from the end of 2017 what that means... it could be a bit bumpy! We're standing by to fix any issues. The major reason for this mainline is that we've done a massive Code audit that touched almost 3000 different core engine files to better optimize Warframe. While this Update brings you some new fashion frame options for Mesa and 3 new Augments, the majority of this Update is focused on bringing fixes and Quality of Life changes. If that's not what you're after, we've got lots of great stuff coming very soon. The Plains are going to get a lot more dangerous at night in an upcoming Update.....\n\nYou can now damage Vay Hek up to 25% of his total Health (was 10% previously) while his Propaganda Drone is active before it shuts off. This will result in less waiting around, and will make Vay Hek in Terra Frame easier to deal with.\nReduced base Armor of Vay Hek in his Terra Frame from 225 to 200.\nGhoul Lore Fragments are simply way more likely to drop within Bounties now.\nGhoul enemies themselves can now also drop the Lore Fragments (and Ghouls always have a chance to appear outside of Ghoul Bounties!).  \nGhoul Bounty tables have received new items including Nitain, Cetus Wisps, and Breath of the Eidolon!\nEquinox's Night-Form 'Mend' now regenerates Shields of Allies as enemies are killed within range.\nIncreased the drop chance of Intact Sentient Cores from Vomvalysts to 100%.\nUpdated description of Kwath (Grip) to properly inform of its stats: \n\"Light weight\" now reads \"Heavy weight\"\n\"increase in speed\" now reads \"increase in damage\"\n\"cost of damage\" now reads \"cost of speed\".\nUpdated the description on Zaw balances to say \"link\" instead of \"counterweight\".\nRemoved the Mastery Rank 2 requirement from the MK1-Furis.\nUpdated the Design Council tips that appear in the loading screen and removed some that don’t apply anymore.\nBounties are now Mastery Rank tiered! In the current system, a player of any Mastery Rank could queue up and join any Bounty, even the highest level ones! In order to avoid a mismatch in experience, we've simply set each Bounty to have a default Mastery Rank. It looks a little something like this: \nWhen the Acolytes are live, players will only see them in the World State panel once they've completed Vor's Prize.\nEidolon Lures now follow both Warframe or Operator rather than just the Warframe. The Lure will also now teleport to the player it’s following if/when it gets too far away/stuck. \nWarframe Specters are now much smarter! If you don't recall, Specters are craftable gear you can equip to summon an AI companion in battle. We've done a general intelligence pass on their proficiency with Weapons, and we've also updated their power-casting logic. Virtually every power is now castable with only a few exceptions! Specters CANNOT cast the following Abilities: Vauban's Minelayer, Ivara's Zipline, Titania's Razorwing, Nekros’ Desecrate and Shadows of the Dead, Excalibur’s Exalted Blade, Valkyr’s Hysteria, Wukong’s Primal Fury, Cloud Walker, and Defy, Atlas’ Petrify and Tectonics, Limbo's entire kit (save for the damage aspect of Banish), and finally Zephyr’s Dive Bomb. \nSecurity cameras now trigger more intelligently, the Corpus have upgraded their software. \nImproved the UI on Defection missions by having instruction text, aligning objectives, and better colour coding for defector icons. \nIncreased duration of Duality Augment to be 10 seconds at Max Rank (affected by Duration Mods).\nSecond Dream now has two vaults instead of three during the first Spy mission.  \nDisabled Stalker, Arc traps, and random transmissions during some quest missions. \nUpdated some doors which still had red non-interactive locked materials to new off versions. \nInstead of redundantly showing both Fire Rate and Charge Rate on bows, they now hide Fire Rate unless comparing to a non-bow weapon. \nChanged the background on selected Tenno customizations to be the same white as when selecting customizations from the Arsenal. \nImproved Sprint/Toggle Sprint so that sprinting stops less often. \nStanding in place with sprint key down no longer causes the sprint posture (for the purposes of Prowl and such).\nWhen a player tries to sell their last Sentinel, a more informative message will appear to explain why it cannot be sold. \nSomachord now continues playing where you left off when you return to your Orbiter.\nSomachord Tones now have their own marker icon when waypointing/finding one in a mission.\nRemoved the \"kill unalerted enemies\" or \"hack 1 terminal\" Challenges from The Law of Retribution and The Jordas Verdict.\nThe War Within Choice Scene has been changed to be untradable.\nTweaked the Cryona Syandana default Tint colors to better match the original Steam Workshop image. \nIncreased the Health of the Loki Specter in the Neptune Junction on Uranus.\nRemoved the equip sound from the Fishing Spear.\nChanged the 'disable sniper scopes' HUD option to be 'use sniper scopes' instead to fit with the positive style of other option wordings.\nIncreased follow radius of Drone in the Drone Hijack Incursion from 30m to 50m.\nLowered health of Grineer Auto Turrets from 1250 to 1100. \nLowered health from 650 to 550 and armor from 100 to 75 of the big Dropship Turret.\nTweaked wording/order in the Landing Craft menu:\nRenamed ‘PLACE DECORATIONS’ to ‘DECORATE’\nRenamed ‘CUSTOMIZE INTERIOR’ to ‘INTERIOR COLORS’\nFlipped the order of those two options\nNox enemies will now react when being damaged by a Stealth attack. Before they would remain not alerted after taking some stealthy damage.\nOperators will now automatically go back into Void Mode after a Void Blast if crouch is still being held (and they have enough Energy).\nReplaced old damaged Liset ship in Vor’s Prize cinematic with new damaged version.\nSabotage missions on Settlement, Shipyards, and Gas City tilesets now have 2 stages.\nThe Arca Plasmor received a change yesterday where headshots no longer deal bonus damage. The Arca Plasmor was designed to hit multiple targets with a high-status chance, but with wide wave projectiles and inherent punch-through, a single shot could result in multiple headshots. With it being a shotgun, it was never intended to behave as a precision weapon, and the bonus pushed it too far out of that mold.\nHowever! While this has changed, headshots should still deal damage (without the multiplier). Currently, there is a bug where headshots deal absolutely 0 damage. This is obviously not intended, and we are working on a fix to resolve this issue.    \nWe apologize for missing this in the original version of the update notes for 22.10.0! As we’ve mentioned before, mainline updates can be a bit rocky (last night’s 4 a.m. ET hotfix for example). Thank you for your understanding.\nConclave Stance Fateful Truth Leading Blade combo now only hits once during the dash.\nConclave Stance Fateful Truth Sudden Spring combo damage reduced.\n",

Enjoy your holidays with some new gear and more while we enjoy ours, and we'll return in 2018 well rested and ready to rock!\nFragments in your Codex are now categorized based on their origin (Cephalon, Cetus, Gara, and Ghouls).  \nYou can now replay Bounties for Standing!\nYou can now use Emotes in your Orbiter! Deep bows all around.\nMirage's Hall of Mirrors casting animation has been changed to match the style of the Mirage Prime trailer! \nRemoved reticle animation when sprinting due to feedback. \nImproved sound ambience and performance on a Grineer Settlement tileset door. \nThe body tendrils on Nezha’s Yaksha Tennogen Skin is now tintable and will take tints from the tertiary slot. \nLieutenant Lech Kril changes: \nLech Kril will now prioritize using his ice abilities instead of melee when he can.\nUpon destroying Lech Kril's backpack, his ice abilities will have their cooldowns reset to reduce time spent waiting around.\nChanged Lech Kril's Ice Wave ability so that it doesn’t halt the fight when players are meleeing him. \nAdded FX to Lech Kril's weakspot that changes tint based on how much damage his backpack has taken to help make the objective clearer to new player. \nVery slightly tweaked hitbox location for backpack to try and achieve more consistent damage. \nWhen Decorating your Dojo, your selected Decoration will now be deselected if you type into the search bar and the Decoration in question does not appear on the results page.

Cantilevered leg augments propel the unit toward the fray at speed, while over\nand under-mounted extendable drill carriages magnify both reach and penetrating power.\nGHOUL AUGER ALPHA \nWhether through aberrant cognition or sheer brutality one specimen always moves to the front of each pack. It is from this individual that the other units take their lead. \n  \nGHOUL DEVOURER \nVay Hek's personal favorite, the Devourer is a maximal terror unit. Draped in shreds of the diapause bag that birthed it, this gap-mawed monstrosity barrels toward prey with furious intensity. Wrist-mounted hooks are welded to elbow joints and hyperpowered by a myotechnological winch system for maximum impact-and-pull.\nGHOUL EXPIRED \nThe Expired are Ghouls who have succumbed to malnutrition or environmental poisoning during the early stages of development. Their backup nervous systems continue to drive them forward, however, making them ideal suicide troops.\nGHOUL EXPIRED DESERTER \nWhy this emaciated monstrosity chose to abandon its pack remains to be seen.\nGHOUL RICTUS \nSo named for its terrifying leer, the Rictus (AKA 'the Sawman') lives to divide and conquer its foes \nliterally. \n  \nGHOUL RICTUS ALPHA \nThis specimen shows evidence of advanced cognitive abilities and greater, if rudimentary, situational analysis.

These currently unreleased changes (discussed in Devstream #103) will include grid snapping, placing floating decorations, and much more!\nWarframe Articula: Posable scale models of your favorite Warframes are here! To place, open your decoration tool and select “Warframe Articula”. Once you’ve found the perfect spot, customize by selecting from your existing loadouts, choosing a pose from the “Warframe Gun Pose Set”, and swapping weapons!

  "changes": "Plains Of Eidolon: Update 22.6.0:\nTenno!\nWe’re bringing you what we call a “mainline” update today. This is every fix and QoL change we have been working on since October in addition to content drops. 22.6.0 sets the stage for a bigger end of year Update that includes Khora and more!\nIt’s important to note that sometimes mainline updates can be rocky since they have deep overhauls for optimization within.\nWe will be actively watching for bugs and your feedback on the additions and changes below!\nThe Plains of Eidolon now have changing weather patterns! This new dynamic weather system brings rain, lightning, rolling thunder, as well as fluctuating wind and cloud patterns. The Plains can shift from sunshine to rain (and vice versa) during the day and night, and rain will linger for a reasonable amount of time.\nJumping in puddles isn’t the only good thing about being out in the Plains during the rain! Take advantage of increased fish spawns and reduced visibility for the Grineer while it is raining.\nA rain slider has also been added to the Plains of Eidolon Captura Scene. Adjust the slider from a light trickle to total downpour and capture your dramatic side!\nSince the launch of Focus 2.0 in Update 22: Plains of Eidolon, you have shared your thoughts and suggestions on where we could improve on Operator gameplay as a whole. Focus 2.5 is a reflection of what we’ve learned through your experiences, and acts as a jumping-off point for future implementations that need more consideration before they reach you (daily cap removal for example).\nBelow you will find a breakdown of what has changed in Focus 2.5. If you would like to read more about our intent and motivation for these changes, and some of our future plans for Operator gameplay, head on over to “The Features of Focus 2.5” Dev Workshop thread .\nWe have added shared pool capacity! You can now upgrade your pool size using the points from any School you wish, which increases the maximum capacity for every school all at once.\nYou can increase pool capacity from your active tree. Simply select a School of choice as your “primary” and use its Focus points to increase the shared pool capacity.\nThe ability to increase capacity from within the tree itself still exists, but these points will contribute to the shared pool instead.\nThe costs of unlocking nodes across all trees have, on average, been reduced by almost 30%. The table below compares what a 5 rank passive node (like Zenurik’s Energy Pulse) costs before and after these changes:\n\nVoid Singularity’s pull speed has been doubled.  \nLightning Dash now costs 10 energy per cast.\nGuardian Blast now grants 160 shields at max, up from 100.\nProtective Dash now grants 5s of immunity at max, up from 2s.\nVoid Spines now reflects 100% damage at max, up from 25%.\nStone Skin now adds flat armor, 60 for both Warframe and Operator at max.\nVoid Strike now continues accumulating damage boosts over multiple uses of void mode, each rank adds additional attacks up to a max of 8.\nBlazing Dash now stuns enemies instead of ragdolling.\nWe are excited to see how you feel about these changes, and will be collecting your feedback on Focus 2.5 changes in the dev workshop we posted earlier this week.\nThe following Incursions can now occur in Caves scattered around the Plains: Exterminate, Assassinate, and Cache Recovery. The objectives in these Incursions are the same as they are in the Plains, but there is now a chance for these to randomly take place in caves!\nThe intent of the following changes is to make fishing a more harmonious experience for you and your squad! Until now, Bait, Dye, and Pharoma has only exclusively affected the player who used it. Moving forward, all squadmates will receive benefits from Bait or other fishing consumables in the Plains. The fish you see will still vary from player to player, however, the effects of these consumables will be shared across all members.\nWhen making this change, we also reviewed how each of these consumables worked and tweaked them slightly for the sake of consistency and balance:\nYou can now throw Pharoma and Luminous Dye like Bait!*\nDye, Pharoma and Bait now only work within a certain radius around its casting point. Any player fishing within the radius around this casting point will benefit from its effects.\n*In order for Luminous Dye and Pharoma to work within this system, they are now thrown like bait. They float in the water and affect all fish in the same body of water within a certain radius. This way you can cast out the Dye in one place, and all players will see the fish get highlighted as they swim near it. Multiple Dyes can be used at once, if you want to affect a larger section of the water.\nFinally, we made the following changes and fixes to fishing:\nAdded custom Bait throwing animation.\nActive Bait will no longer be destroyed by fish.\nReduced fish escape speed when spooked.\nFixes towards fish swimming through terrain.\nFixed rare case where fishing Bait would not float properly.\nFixes towards Bait being destroyed if thrown into shallow ponds where the bait would hit the bottom before floating to the surface.\nFixed clients being able to throw one more Bait than they actually have.\nFixed an issue where some fish could swim in the air.\nMass Vitrify is no longer invulnerable and now has sections that break off and explode as it absorbs incoming damage. The amount of damage absorbed scales with Power Strength and Armor. Explosion damage scales with Power Strength. \nMass Vitrify no longer has a duration and remains until recast, destroyed from damage, or smashed with Shattered Lash.\nGara is still relatively new as far as Warframes are concerned but since her release, we’ve found (and many players have found) that an invulnerable and almost impenetrable barrier doesn’t allow for a very engaging gameplay experience. We know that other Warframes also have Powers with similar issues, but adding a shattering component to Mass Vitrify is a change we could easily implement that is consistent with Gara’s glass theme while also making Mass Vitrify more interactive.\nWith these new changes, we can tweak the absorption and explosion values as necessary to make sure Mass Vitrify is both fun and effective. Please keep your feedback constructive and let us know what you think after you’ve had a chance to test these new changes.\nReduced Electric Shield’s Energy Cost per meter to 1 Energy per 4 meters (down from 1 per 1 meter)\nWe previously announced changes to Discharge in this thread. But after further testing, we found that the changes were a lot more powerful than anticipated (we’ve included a video below). As a result, Discharge has not been changed yet. We will continue to work on Discharge improvements before releasing them in a future update. Sorry for getting anyone excited prematurely for Discharge! We appreciate your patience.\nPreviously proposed Discharge changes that ended up with more extreme crowd control than expected \nmodded here for extended range and lower damage. (not live!):\nSpoiler\nReticle will turn blue when targeting allies and red when targeting enemies.\nReticle will show different states for hip, aim and sprint.\nContext actions will dim when aiming while they are active.\nAll non-endless Solar Map and quest missions now display short objective instructions for each stage with a matching marker icon in the UI, similar to those displayed on the Plains.. Some endless missions also have new objective text. \nSimplified and cleaned up any existing objective UI's general alignment, ordering and spacing to make it more readable. \nReworded language in some existing missions’ objective UI for clarity, and added more appropriate text to some timers instead of the generic 'Time'.\nFixed many small consistency issues and bugs with objective markers and replaced some existing mission markers with area markers where appropriate.\nAdded area markers to Hive missions to cover highlight areas where the destroyable tumor nodes spawned around each hive.\nDuring long dialog stages in quests, there will now always be an area marker so that players don't get confused about where they should be.\nChanged timer description in Rescue missions to “Time Limit” instead of “Time Left”. \nIn-world markers for Incursion/Bounty objectives locations will no longer disappear for others when someone reaches it first \nit will persist for players who aren't in the area yet. \nIn-world markers for Incursion/Bounty objectives will reappear if you leave the objective area.\nThe countdown timer when leaving the perimeters of an objective in the Plains has moved to a more visible spot in the UI. It also states that you are “abandoning objective”. \nChanged the marker for downed Capture targets from red to a yellow objective marker \nthis will make it clearer to players that they need to use the context action instead of continuing to damage the target.\nObjective timers are now greyed out when paused.\n'Get to extraction' objective appears on the UI when extraction is enabled (excludes missions where extraction is optional).\nExtraction Timer text changed from 'Time:' to 'Extracting In:' so it can't be confused with other active timers.\nSome missions with large extraction zones like landing pads now use a green area extraction marker. Adjusted some extraction zones so that they fill the whole landing pad and marker area, instead of half of a landing pad.\nRemoved panels from Corpus doors which never did anything to avoid new player confusion because they would light up during lockdowns.\nFixed missing markers on Corpus co-op doors.\nThe Rescue Target in the Plains now has a HUD health indicator located under your mini-map.  \nFixed objective waypoint not disappearing after successfully destroying the Reactor in Sabotage missions.\nFixed Bounty waypoint directing players to extraction when Archwing is immediately deployed upon entering the Plains. \nFixed objective waypoint not disappearing after successfully taking the Vessel from the tomb in the last mission of the Sands of Inaros Quest.\nFixed some Markers being stuck in the at origin on the minimap. \nFixed unlocked icon appearing very dimly on Grineer doors.\nMade performance and memory optimizations to the Plains of Eidolon and other tilesets. If you were experiencing crashes before, we hope that these changes will be the fix!\nThe Corpus Gas City and Grineer Settlement tilesets have received an audio remaster! We revised the sounds in these tiles and used updated engine tech so that certain ambient sounds are more noticeable and clear. The remaster adds more character and personality to the audio and will also make enemies easier to pick out. \nTime between Incursions will increase if you let an Incursion alert expire. The Lotus can take a hint!\nA single Vomvalyst in its energy-form near multiple Lures will now only feed a charge to a single Lure. However, to improve overall survivability of the Lures, we have changed Eidolon Lures to always spawn at level 30 regardless of Bounty level or distance from the gate.\nHunter Command Mod change: your Companion will now focus on an enemy for a set duration when they are first slash proc’d by you. While focused on a target, they will ignore any other newly proc’d enemies and will go back to their default behavior after the duration expires.\nOperators and Ostron Vendors in Cetus have had their eyes beautified with shaders.\nThe beams from Trinity’s Link now fade out when the Ability has ended.\nLephantis’ melee attacks will now knock you back if you’re hit!\nSmoothed NPC movement for clients with a poor connection to host.\nReplaced an old version of the reactor in Grineer Settlement Sabotage with the newer (and fewer-pronged) version used in the Grineer Shipyard Tileset. \nRemoved blue undertone from Nekros Irkalla’s energy wisps.\nImproved AI pathing in the Grineer Asteroid tileset. \nOverall UI optimizations. \nReduced number of stasis mines in Archwing Rush.\nAdded 'destroyable' shine FX to mines in Archwing Rush. \nA Skiff VIP has been added to the list of commanders in Dynamic Assassinate Incursions.\nImproving the responsiveness of loadouts in Relays and Cetus. \nMade improvements towards less hitches in Relays.\nImproved AI pathing on the Grineer Settlement tileset. \nAudio will now properly resume if your audio device is disconnected and then reconnected. \nGrineer Melee enemies on the Plains are now able to climb to the top of the Storage Containers.  \nTuned down the bloom on the wings of the Chroma Vojnik Battle-Damaged Tennogen Skin.\nImproved lighting on the Lua tileset doors. \nChanged “enemies are dead” transmission to “broken their ranks” transmission in Invasion missions. \nUpdated one of Lotus’ lines for the Mastery Rank 25 test to better match the test.\n",

The Daily Standing Cap for Cetus works identically to all other Syndicates, and can be viewed under your Profile!\nAs you venture through Cetus, you will encounter many unique townspeople.

Be sure to view Hok's Other Services to find out how to make your Zaw (and other Melee weapons) your own!\nThe Plains of Eidolon is an ancient battlefield where Sentients fought to destroy the Orokin Tower that the Ostrons now call home. The Sentients failed and died, leaving behind an ancient graveyard throughout the Landscape. The towering Spectral Sentients known as Eidolons survived the Old War. Every night they ascend from the waters and wander the Plains in search of what they’ve lost. Small, deadly Sentients appear throughout the Plains and protect the Eidolon. At daybreak, they disappear and wait for night to emerge once more.\nThe Grineer have organized drilling stations and sprawling outposts throughout the Plains to excavate the technology of the Old War. Fight Grineer during the day and clear out their bases, but be fast as these Grineer will call reinforcements when they spot danger. As you venture deeper into the Plains, there will be tougher Grineer enemies so come prepared. When night falls, some Grineer will retreat to their camps and attempt to wait it out while reinforcing their outposts and repairing their equipment for the new day.\nSaving your Progress on the Plains happens in a number of ways \nmost of which are automatic!\n\nExperience the great outdoors as you fish in the rivers and streams.

There are 3 reusable fishing spear blueprints available for purchase, each specializing in catching specific types of fish:\nHai-Luk also offers Gear to aid in your fishing efforts, and 4 kinds of Bait Blueprints that may be crafted using components from filleted fish and Resources collected in the Plains.\nBefore heading out into the Plains, add your spear of choice to your Gear wheel in your Arsenal. \nFind a body of water, open your Gear wheel (or use your hotkey), and select your spear to enter fishing mode. \nAiming and shooting with the spear works just as it does when launching other spear weapons.\nAim at an unknowing fish and toss your spear for a chance to reel in your catch!\nUse your equipped Bait by pressing the Alt Fire button.\nBy visiting Old Man Suumbaat in Cetus, you can acquire a Cutter to carve resources straight from the rocks of the Plains. Three different reusable Cutter blueprints can be purchased for Standing:\nOnce you have acquired your blueprint and crafted your Cutter, enter the Plains. The ancient battle has left traces of energy on those Plains, and this affects the Landscape, including the very rock formations!

Find it and its blueprint in the Market today!\n\nIt's been almost two years since we released the first version of Focus. Focus comes as a system unlocked upon completion of 'The Second Dream'. After answering a series of questions from The Lotus, you (the Operator) chose a Focus school and began your journey through a series of Passives that you needed to unlock all the while earning the Focus points to do so. Then came The War Within, where your Operator became playable with a few abilities meant mainly to help you earn Kuva and participate in Quests.\nThe core purpose of this rework is to shift the goals of the Focus system away from supplementing Warframes and towards making your Operator more combat-ready. This means that there will be more of a balance between Passives and Actives under Focus 2.0.\nLet's start with some very important facts about all your accrued Focus Points and installed Lenses:\nThe Daily Focus Cap has increased from 100,000 to 250,000 Focus per day.\nConvergence Orbs now yield an 8x multiplier versus a 6x.\nNow we shall talk Passives, Residuals, and Actives.\nActives in their current form on the public build are at the behest of a 100 HP pool for the Operator. The Active and Passive Focus paths in Focus 2.0 aim to increase your Operator’s survivability and to give you the option to approach combat with added Operator support and armaments. Only a few encounters will necessitate this and as the game and feedback grows we will develop accordingly.\nAs far as the Focus Schools themselves, we have clear cut the trees of the old system and are rebuilding entirely new ability paths. We are also including cross-Focus nodes you can unlock within different trees!\nMany benefits of the new Focus trees are linked to the activation of the Operator or Operator Abilities (Void Dash, Void Blast, Void Mode).\nWe have reduced the Pool Increase costs significantly and distributed the Focus point investment more into the nodes.\nOperator AMPS: Operator Weapons!\nTenno who seek out the Eidolon Hunter will be exposed to an Operator Weaponry system.\nOperators will be able to wield a new Modular weaponized system that attaches to their arm, called an AMP.

  "changes": "Warframe Update 22: Plains Of Eidolon:\n\nOur biggest update, ever, Plains of Eidolon has finally arrived! First off, thank you for checking it out!\nIf you're new to Warframe \noh hi! You’ve arrived at an interesting time in our multi-year journey. We hope you’ll stay a while and join our little space-ninja community. Cetus and its open landscape, Plains of Eidolon, have been placed early on in the progression path on Earth so that you can experience them as soon as possible!\nIf you’re a Founder \na Veteran \na Prime Access supporter \nplease know that it is by your hand that this crazy update is even possible. This update is dedicated to you.\nPlains of Eidolon, with its expansive landscape and all-new dynamic game systems, represents the ongoing evolution of Warframe. Our continuing mission: to create a game that feels alive, that challenges its creators and its players alike. A game that lives up to the amazing community that has grown around it.\nSome quick facts you might want to know about how Cetus & the Plains of Eidolon work!\nThe Plains of Eidolon and Cetus operate on a persistent asymmetrical Day/Night Cycle. As the sun rises and sets, different gameplay systems become available! The details are:\nThese Update notes have close to 25 pages of information explaining the Update. The Plains of Eidolon is new for all Tenno \ntake your time and enjoy discovering how to make your way through the systems.\nThere are two energy sources for your Operator: 1 for Void Beam, and another for Void Dash, Void Mode, and Void Blast. Both energy sources regen over time, and energy pickups only affect the latter abilities.\n\n\nTo create more flow with Transference between Operator and Warframe, you can now seamlessly transition to your Operator and back to your Warframe at any time \neven when in mid bullet jump! \nYou can now double tap “shift” to perform a slide as the Operator. \nWhen in Operator mode, Warframes now have a 90% damage reduction from enemies if an ability is active during Transference. If no ability is active during Transference, you Warframe is invulnerable and untargetable.\nFor 2 weeks following the Plains of Eidolon, our first ever Twitch Drops Campaign is live!https://www.warframe.com/news/the-great-eidolon-hunt\nEverything you need to know about this campaign can be found in this handy image:\n\nIf you are wondering who to tune into, see here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/849289-twitch-drops-prep-and-exclusive-sigil-drop/\nPlains of Eidolon has been added to the list of eligible Sortie regions!\nThe Void has been added to the list of eligible Sortie regions! Sorties that occur in the Void will have every mission take place in the Void. \nModular Melee Rivens have been added to the Sortie Reward Pool! These are different from Melee Rivens in that they are made for Zaw weapon combinations.\nKuva (6000) has been added to Sortie Rewards.\nLenses have been removed from Sortie Rewards \nbasic Lenses have been added to Bounties.\nOne of Warframe’s biggest appeals is the diverse selection of weaponry. Even within the subclasses of rifles and pistols, there is huge variety to be found, such as the distinction between projectile weapons (firing physical projectiles which move through space, like the Boltor) and hitscan weapons (firing draws an imaginary line between the gun and the point aimed at, doing damage instantly to whatever it hits, like the Soma). For obvious reasons, hitscans are very effective at long distances \nthis has never been an issue with Warframe’s tileset-based gameplay, but as we shot enemies from a kilometer away in the plains with our pistols, we knew something had to be done.\n \nWith the release of Plains of Eidolon, most weapons will have a form of damage falloff added, to reduce their effectiveness at extremely long distances. But don’t panic! This damage falloff will only be noticeable at extreme ranges (greater than 300m). Across all of our current tilesets, we were unable to find an unobstructed line of sight longer than 300m, so that is the point at which damage falloff will start.\nReticle sway removed from all zoom levels!\n1 meter punch through added to all snipers without any to start with (snipers with innate punch through unchanged).\n1 combo count removed at a time when duration runs out instead of all of them (decay vs. cooldown).\n1 combo count removed on miss instead of all of them\nAdditional bullets from multishot will each count as their own hits and misses in the combo counter\nCombo duration reduced to 2 seconds for all snipers apart from Lanka which is reduced to 6\nDamage fall off begins at 400 meters and ends at 600 meters with damage reduced to 50% past 600 meters.\nFirst level zoom +10% Damage replaced with +30% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +50% Head Shot Damage\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2.67\nFirst level zoom +15% Damage replaced with +35% Head Shot Damage\nFirst level zoom reduced from 4x to 3.5x\nSecond level zoom 20% Damage replaced with +55% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom reduced from 10x to 6x\nNext round is chambered immediately after firing instead of waiting for fire rate to cycle\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2\nFirst level zoom +10% Damage replaced with +30% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +50% Head Shot Damage\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2\nFirst level zoom +10% Damage replaced with +30% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +50% Head Shot Damage\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2.67\nFirst level zoom reduced from 5x to 3.5x\nSecond level zoom reduced from 12x to 6x\nFirst level zoom +15% Damage replaced with +35% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +55% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom reduced from 6x to 4x\nThird level zoom 20% Damage replaced with +70% Head Shot Damage\nThird level zoom reduced from 12x to 8x\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2\nFirst level zoom +15% Damage replaced with +35% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +55% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom reduced from 6x to 4x\nThird level zoom 20% Damage replaced with +70% Head Shot Damage\nThird level zoom reduced from 12x to 8x\nCharge rate decreased from 1.5 to 1\nSecond level zoom reduced from 7x to 5x\nThird level zoom reduced from 12x to 8x\nVasto Prime Mastery Rank increased from 0 to 3.\nVasto Prime damage increased from 60 to 70.\nVasto Prime status chance increased from 15 to 20%.\nVasto Prime critical chance increased from 15 to 20%.\nAll trace fire weapons trace distance reduced to 300m apart from Sniper Rifles which stay at 1000m.\nMagnetic Damage Status Effects now drain energy over time as opposed to completely draining all energy. \nChanged Ayatan Star markers to only display if you're within 100 meters or so range of the drop.. Amber Star markers will also appear larger due to their rarity and to avoid confusion. \nMaroo's Bazaar is now located on Mars.\nAdjusted the Nyx Carnifex Helmet and Skin colors to match original design. \nToned down the density of the Zenistars FX.\nRemoved stagger on hit from Grineer Flameblade units.\nCapture missions will no longer have the chance to change to the Exterminate objective in Kuva Siphon missions.\nImproved the mesh quality of the Angstrum and Prisma Angstrum to avoid blocky textures. \nCompanions will no longer lose integrity if a print is in the process of being distilled to prevent unexpected death.\nChanged metal material assignment for ceilings in the Corpus Tilesets to improve performance. \nImproved Corpus Dropship passenger animations and increased the speed at which they drop the Corpus reinforcements. \nCranked down the intensity of Nox’s helmet smash and explosion upon death sound FX.    \nThe following items are now color tintable:\nAll Vandal and Wraith weapons.\nThe Harkonar Wraith Armour and Syandana.\nUpdated icons for the Lato and Braton Vandal.\nImproved Jat Kusar weapon trail so that it is more visible. \nToned down lens flair on Nekros' idle. \nImproved Operator movement animations in the Landing Craft to remove weird leg and arm motions. \nChanged the TennoGen Knaita Mag skin’s default colors to match the Steam Workshop’s main image.

The blueprints will be removed and if they were under construction, the resources and credits will be refunded (except for the argon crystals for The Limbo Theorem, sorry!).\nAnti-MOAs are now able to spawn in Exterminate and Mobile Defense missions on Jupiter.\nTweaked the glass material on the Orokin capsules in the first mission of Vor’s Prize.\nUpdated Quaro Sugatra’s material rigidness to make it perform more like metal. \nUpdated the Liset’s appearance in the cinematic during the first mission of Vor’s Prize.\nCleaned up a small patch of unintended Infestation on the Corpus Outpost tileset. Looks like those Corpus janitors were really slacking!\nThe Gear wheel can now have up to 12 items!\nThe in-game Market now includes a separate category for Warframe Deluxe Bundles! \nThe Ayatan Star installing prompt will now only display once per Ayatan installing session rather than on every socket. \nImproved Hydroid’s Tempest Barrage when aiming through doorways. The Barrage will better hit the aimed location than the actual doorway. \nTweaked the Hydroid Graxx Skin default colors to better match original design.\nReduced the range at which NPCs see ragdolls / projectiles etc \nthis helps reduce the chance an NPC will see a body a long distance away and become alert.\nOptimized scripts used by Defection missions.\nOptimized the Infested Tar Moa sounds. \nMade many small performance optimizations to all Warframe abilities.\nOptimized Coolant Leak Mod slightly. \nRemoved being able to Quick Revive yourself when dueling in the Dojo.\nThe Sharpened Claws Kavat Mod now only applies the Armour debuff when actually dealing damage.

This polish essentially speaks to the question 'What do I do when I'm done Vor's Prize'?\nHydroid’s Undertow now displays an ability counter of how many enemies are currently submerged.\nRiven Slot capacity limit has increased from 60 to 90! With 90 as the new Riven Slot capacity limit, this gives room for 30 of each Riven school (Primary, Secondary, Melee) which we believe has been a common request! \nWarframe’s first Prime Sentinel, Wyrm Prime, has had its base Health increased from 100 to 225! \nReduced the Razorback Cipher cost from 3500 Polymer Bundle to 1500 Polymer Bundle. Back in May of this year we made numerous fixes towards the Razorback Armada, and with another Armada to appear soon we took a second look at the Polymer friction involved with this non-useable Blueprint. See here for past fixes you can expect: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/797284-sharpening-our-razorbacks-a-pc-weekend-post-mortem/\nReloading can now be interrupted by throwing the Javlok, and can be thrown after depleting all primary fire without having to wait for it to fully reload.\nSpecific Auto-generated messages will be removed from your Inbox 30 days after opening them to clean up some unnecessary database space. Only the following time-sensitive Inbox notifications will be affected:\nStalker Death Marks\nInvasion Battle Pay\nDouble Credit and Affinity Weekends \nImproved performance when using Melee weapons with Mods that increase Range.\nPicking up disarmed thrown Secondary weapons (Kunai, Castanas, etc.) will now display the context action “Pick Up Thrown Weapon” instead of “Pick up Auto Pistol”.\nRemoved unnecessary \"Mastery Rank X Required\"Codex text from Quests that are given directly to players after completing Junctions.\nOptimized loading screens.\nImproved the Angstrum's explosion FX.\nInaros and Nidus can now use No Current Leap Mod in Conclave\nReduced the damage AoE radius of the Castanas family in Conclave.\nIncreased the damage AoE radius of the Talons in Conclave.\nIncreased duration of the Final Act Mod to 8 seconds and updated the description text in Conclave.\nUpdated the description text of Tactical Retreat Mod in Conclave.\nFixed seeing Warframe’s in a T-pose when attempting to leave a Team Annihilation lobby in Conclave.  \nFixed being able to throw an unstable Lunaro ball at ultra fast speeds due to high latency in Lunaro.\n",

We will aim to revisit as a feature when more time emerges. \nFixed Operator Void Beam not being functional after swapping weapons while initiating the Scanner.\nFixed being able to walk on top of Grineer Spy Vault consoles when attempting to hack. This resulted in accidently tripping alarms and canceling the hacking.\nFixed a specific teleport volume in the Orokin Derelict killing your Sentinel. \nFixed NPCs that can be given a Secondary weapon, firing the Zakti at an impossibly fast rate. \nFixed numerous weapon meshes appearing incorrectly on the ground when disarmed by a Drahk Master.\nFixed the Convectrix not having a pickup context action when disarmed by a Drahk Master. \nFixed the Operator getting stuck in an idle animation after returning to the Landing Craft during The War Within quest. \nFixed the Perrin Sequence Sigil appearing bumpy.\nFixed the Equinox Insomnia Skin appearing incorrectly when viewed in the Star Chart.\nFixed the Hulta Armor clipping into Rhino Prime. \nFixed numerous Syandanas clipping through Chroma’s Effigy pelt.\nFixed being able to see 'Health' of Kuva Ghosts even though they don't die or have Health. \nFixed a crash when viewing Mission Progress after changing Sentinels in the Simulacrum. \nFixed Limbo remaining in the Rift when switching Warframe’s in the Simulacrum Arsenal.\nFixed Growing Power scaling indefinitely for Clients as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/833798-growing-power-scales-infinitely/\nFixed Veiled Rivens requiring ‘no damage taken’ resetting progress when hit if no Health/Shield damage is taken but you got knocked down. \nFixed an escapable level hole in the Grineer Fortress Spy tileset as seen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/6wljmo/an_impractical_alternate_route_on_kuva_fortress/\n",

  "additions": "\nIn response to a disturbing transmission from Palladino, the Red Veil Syndicate’s spiritual medium, Tenno are compelled to investigate a dark, mysteriously abandoned Steel Meridian spacecraft found adrift. Inside the vessel, lights flicker and emergency lights strobe. All is quiet except for whispers of “Rap. Tap. Tap,” heard echoing throughout the lifeless craft. What does it all mean? Players must uncover the terrifying reality of what happened onboard, how the Red Veil might play a part in it, and more.\nIf you have completed The War Within Quest and have unlocked the Mot node in the Void the Chains of Harrow Quest will be automatically added to your Codex.\nChains of Harrow Quest is also replayable after completion \nenjoy it all over again!\n\nAlways prepared to sacrifice. This monastic Warframe uses the Void to bolster allies’ defenses and amplify their lethality.\nGet Harrow today by purchasing him in the Market for Platinum, or by completing the Chains of Harrow quest and finding his parts! His parts can be found in the Defection mission type, Grineer Fortress Spy missions, and from enemies corrupted by Void Fissures!\n\nPreviewed in the Operation: Ambulas Reborn, 6 Syndicate Weapon Augments are back and here to stay!\nAvenging Truth\nEntropy Detonation\nStockpiled Blight\nVoltage Sequence\nNeutralizing Justice\nDisarming Purity\nHarrow’s signature Primary weapon, the Scourge is a Corrosive spear gun that shoots wave projectiles with high Punch Through and guaranteed Status Effects. Thrown spears attach a bullet attractor to the heads of all enemies within 14 meters, and continues to pulse every 7 seconds and attaches bullet attractors for 3 seconds wherever it has landed.\nHarrow’s signature Secondary weapon, the Knell, has the utility of a sniper with the sight and zoom with the convenience of a pistol. This single round magazine sidearm grants 100% ammo efficiency for 3 seconds (that can be refreshed when active) and 0.5x Critical Damage added per headshot with a maximum of 3 stacks.\nHarrow’s signature Syandana.\n\nAn alternate helmet for Harrow. Find it in the Market or Alerts!\n\n\nReturn to Warframe’s first planet with a completely new look. Earth Remastered offers improved volumetric lighting, a conversion to PBR materials, and a new vegetation system, which create a mood and atmosphere far more advanced than the original January 2014 update did.\nThe new lush forests of Earth are yours to explore. This Update turns the formerly good-looking planet into a stunningly lush, beautifully lit, alive, organically structured environment.\nWe’ve breathed life into Earth’s ambiance by adding a greater variety of unique sounds as you move between the different areas, connecting tunnels/paths, and between the day and night cycle. You can now experience the sounds of more unique wildlife in the lush forest heavy areas, while the overrun Grineer areas focus more on the clunking and chugging of their machinery. With performance gains and a clearer and more focused mix, Earth now offers a higher level of diversity, adding to the overall experience.\nGhastly in appearance and even more unpleasant in combat, Nox is the newest Grineer experiment, a member of a tactical chem-focus unit, and enemy to the Tenno. Seared by an obsession with toxin and wielding a dart weapon that deals Toxin and Impact damage, Nox leaves clouds of deadly toxin whenever he goes. Take caution, destroying Nox’s helmet will release the toxin trapped inside. This Grineer unit is also extremely unstable and will explode in repulsive fashion when killed.\nYou may encounter Nox in enemy level 15 + Grineer missions.\nDual-wield any thrown Melee Weapon and a single-handed Secondary Weapon to destroy your enemies. Execute unique quick-melee combos and charged throws when dual-wielding for added damage.\nIncreased Critical Chance from 5% to 10% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased damage from 30 to 35\nIncreased Crit Multiplier from 1.5 to 2\nIncreased Critical Chance from 5% to 10% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased damage from 35 to 45\nIncreased Crit Multiplier from 1.5 to 2\nMastery Rank requirement increased to 1\nIncreased Status Chance from 25% to 30% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased damage from 35 to 44\nChanged damage type of recall discharge to Toxin\nIncreased Status Chance from 10% to 15% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased Critical Chance from 10% to 15% for Melee hits and projectiles\nDamage increased from 50 to 70\nRecall discharge damage changed to Ice\nIncreased Mastery Rank requirement from 5 to 6\nIncreased Status Chance from 15% to 20% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased Crit Chance from 5% to 10% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased Crit Multiplier from 1.5 to 2\nIncreased damage from 35 to 45\nIncreased Mastery Rank from 0 to 7\nIncreased Status Chance from 20% to 30% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased Critical Chance from 5% to 15% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased Crit Multiplier from 1.5 to 2\nIncreased damage from 45 to 50\nKnockdown added to recall discharge\nIncreased Mastery Rank requirement from 0 to 10\n\nAdd Notes about your existing friends or create new Notes to send with your future Friend Requests!

Find Harrow Systems + new 'Bane of Corrupted' Mods!\nAdded Galleon, Asteroid and Infested Ship Defection missions to Dark Sector nodes in the Star Chart (Phobos Memphis, Saturn Caracol and Neptune Yursa).\nDefection has been added to the Sortie rotation!\nYour Arsenal of Melee weapons has awaited the Riven treatment and the time has come! Rivens overall now have a 25% chance to be earned from Sorties.\n\nFor the moments where you wish you had a friend (or 3) with you in the Simulacrum to test a build!\n2 new Mandachord instrument packs are here:\nEpsilon Instruments \nElectronic!\nPlogg Instruments \nPop-rock!\n*Find them in your Arsenal for purchase!\nIn order to let you show off Earth Remastered, 3 new Captura Scenes have arrived! These can be obtained in Rare Crates on Earth:\nGrineer Forest Factory Scene\nGrineer Forest Industry Scene \nGrineer Forest Water Pump Scene\n2 Quest related Captura rooms have also been added \nbut spoilers mean we won't say too much. If you've finished Octavia's Anthem, you'll find Cephalon Suda offering a new Room. Once you finish Chains of Harrow, Red Veil will offer a new Captura room!\n\nIf you find joy in neon colors flashing to the beat of killing Grineer, plug in that Razer Chroma and enjoy the show! Please note that Razer Chroma and Warframe compatibility is a work-in-progress and more compatibility will be added as we continue to develop it.\n\n23 existing PC Achievements have been added to our Steam Achievements! For those of who you have already completed these in-game, they will be unlocked on Steam when you play the Chains of Harrow update using the Steam launcher.\nWe’ve also added 6 new Achievements to PC (and Steam), bumping the total amount of PC achievements to 172. These were already available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but now it’s our PC Tenno’s turn to try their hand at them:\nDo you think you can complete them all, Tenno?\n\nSpecial item pickups now display on the left side with emphasis rather than on the bottom resource bumper. You'll notice items like Kubrow Eggs, Weapon Blueprints, and other special items picked up in game now have more pizazz!  \nMods that are already equipped on compatible gear now have a desaturated look and icon representing that they cannot be simultaneously used on compatible gear!\nWith Archwing 2.0, players can now fire their weapons while 'sprinting'. This functionality carried over to Submersible missions, but there was no animation to go with it. An animation has been added for this functionality! \nThere is now a Sentient category in the Simulacrum! \nYou can now cycle through multi-option abilities while performing a roll. \nSelecting Emotes in the Arsenal now plays said Emote on your Warframe!\nAdded variants for enemy group knockback and get-up animations when they are struck together. \nAdded a new minimap zone marker for more interesting objectives. You will see the first example of this in Harrow’s Quest!\nAdded custom leap attack animations for the Nikana. \nAdded an “Opponent forfeited” message in Conclave Team Annihilation and Lunaro when the opponent team leaves the match instead of \"Victory\".\nAdded a “Thank you for your purchase” message when buying Slots from your Inventory.\nAdded muzzle flash to shotguns.\nAdded new blood effects for when you shoot or slash your enemies.\n",

Well now it’s firepower sounds even more satisfying! We’ve improved it’s 3D sound to use stereo samples, which gives the Grakata a meatier sound when in close proximity to it.

Clem will be pleased.\nImproved Excavator placement in Corpus Ice Planet tileset Excavation missions.\nDarvo’s got a new groove with his newly PBR’ed outfit! \nImproved the performance of Frost's Ice Wave Impedance Mod.\nClients will now be able to see the Host's Octavia Mallet Range FX for a few seconds when cast.\nDex weapon muzzle flash will now apply the chosen Energy color instead of mixing purple + Energy color.

  "changes": "Octavia’S Anthem: Hotfix 20.6.1oberon Changes:\nObaeron, Broberon, Goat Lord...these are just a few of the names bestowed upon our faithful Oberon. With the dedicated amount of continued feedback and passionate discussions about Oberon’s changes, the time has come to release another round of changes! Oberon Prime is right around the corner so the spotlight will be on him like never before. The changes below were brought forth from Dev discussions and by you, our devoted Tenno. Our goal has always been to give synergy to Oberon’s abilities, while still giving him a way to fill multiple roles in battle. We hope these further changes do just that.\nTweaked Hallowed Ground FX to reduce performance issues.\nRange Mods now apply 75% to Range (distance from Oberon) and 75% to Arc Angle of Hallowed Ground (before was 25% to Range and 75% to Arc before).\nOberon’s Renewal now heals friendly summoned units (IE Nekros’ Shadows of the Dead) at 1/3 the rate but consumes 1/3 the Energy drain for doing so. The change to have Renewal not affect friendly summons was met with varying opinions, and is now further tweaked to meet a happy middle ground. \nOberon’s Renewal Armor buff will be applied to allies anytime they step on Hallowed Ground while Renewal is active on them as opposed to them having to be on Hallowed Ground when Renewal hits them.\nRenewal no longer affects Nidus’ Maggots as to not prevent them from exploding (their intended behavior).\nOberon’s Reckoning Armor debuff is now based on the target's base Armor instead of current Armor (meaning no more diminishing returns).\nPull, Magnetize, and Polarize can now be cast while in motion \ntheir animations now only take place on the upper body. \nRemoved the .75 second delay at the end of Mag’s Crush cast.\nEximus units can now be summoned as Inaros’ Sand Shadows. \nTweaked the Endura Idle FX to better display ‘leafy particles’. \nSaved 10MB of RAM and reduced update and startup time for players that installed from Steam or used the Offline-Installer.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed being unable to craft the Destreza. This also fixes other items requiring Argon Crystals not being craftable. \nFixed crashing or failing to join when using the /join command to enter a player's mission.\nFixed crashing when attempting to enter the Dojo.\nFixed extracting as the Operator not applying Boosters to obtained Kuva.\nFixed a script error when attempting to Randomize your Warframe appearance in the Arsenal.\nFixed retaining the Fissure Primary Weapon buff permanently with Ivara’s Artemis Bow.\nFixed the Nidina Armor not properly applying chosen Energy color. \nFixed the Nidina Armor clipping into Frost/Frost Prime and his Skins.\nFixed some texture issues on the Ivara Youkai Skin. \nFixed some texture issues on the Repala Syandana. \nFixed seeing an empty screen when attempting to place a Decoration in the Obstacle Course. It’s fully intentional that Decorations are not placeable in the Obstacle Course, but the empty screen was not intended to appear.\nFixed underlying/default node's requirements being checked when taxiing to a Sortie mission (ie Kela's Judgement Points).\nFixed being unable to select a Relic in an Endless Fissure mission if a Relic was not brought in the mission from the start.\nFixed Hosts seeing Clients firing multiple bullets when they only fired one. \nFixed some Pistols having a weird left hand movement when firing.\n",

This means Low/Medium/High wager players will not be matchmade together \nyou'll only be put with others that have chosen the same wager. This should mitigate conflicting goals within a Squad.\nWe have made some tweaks to last week's reinforcement: the Cycron! If you haven't picked this up yet yourself, the Cycron doesn't have a reload function; it has a recharge function. As of this Update, the Cycron battery recharge delay time is now halved when the mag is not empty. This means monitoring your ammo while feathering the trigger will be a good strategy when using this weapon. \nWe have made some tweaks to older Warframe Auras. As you may know, an Aura's Mod Rank determines how much additional Mod Capacity you get. We've increased the following Auras form 3 Ranks to 5 Ranks. With this change, we also buffed the Auras: \nSpeed Holster has gone from 80% to 120% at Max Rank.\nDead Eye has gone from 35% to 52.5% at Max Rank.\nEMP Aura has gone from 10% to 15% at Max Rank.\nSprint Boost Aura has gone from 10% to 15% at Max Rank. \nRemoved Lua Spy missions from Sortie rotation due to extensive Client loading times on min spec machines. Please note that we are working to fix this and add Lua Spy missions back into the Sortie rotation.\nAdded an extra line to Limbo's Passive description to speak to his Energy gathering in the Rift.\nImproved experiencing memory loss in the Relays. \nChanged \"CANCEL FUSION\" label to \"BACK\" when reaching max rank on a Mod when Fusing and when there are no pending Fusion tasks.\nReprioritzed a few screens in the Relay so that they load faster even when there's a throng of people around and you're competing for IO bandwidth for their loadouts.\nAdjusted the Rift weight of the Cycron beams in Limb’s Stasis to fix performance issues.\n",

Feedback brought forth further tweaks with the intention to solidify this role.\nRemoved Heal Time from Renewal.

Ammo is now automatically refilled when you run out so you can reload clips.\nOptimized memory use when viewing Clan statistics; in bad cases this could use enough memory to crash 32-bit systems.\nLots of various sound tweaks to Corpus enemy types.\nWeapons that use Batteries as clips will now be affected by Reload Speed Mods.\nArchwing weapons will now display the correct Recharge delay time as Reload in the Arsenal as opposed to some value which has no effect on the weapon.\nArchwing weapons will no longer reset Recharge delay upon firing an empty clip.\nKuva Siphon missions must now be fully completed to earn any Kuva from it.\n",

At some point in Chroma's future we will need to revisit and use ideal methods for his Abilities; we will inform you well in advance when Chroma is under review. As you may or may not know, Oberon is currently under review at this time!\nUpdated the Ability screen and HUD buff numbers to be consistent with other powers.

No longer are your Mod Configurations limited to just 'Config A, Config B, Config C'! You can now customize the names of each Config!\nWhen playing an Endless Mission with AABC reward rotation or a mission with hidden Caches, the UI that reveals which reward has been earned has been updated with a new look!\nYou can now multi-purchase items from Syndicates and Baro Ki' Teer!\nYou can now exchange Stacks of Prime Parts for Ducats using the Middle Mouse Button (the same feature already exists for selecting a stack of Mods to convert to Endo).\nThere is now a Research Tab in the Clan Profile Screen!\nYou can now link your Clan in Chat \nanyone looking to recruit should make note of this!\nYou will now only see categories in your Foundry, Mod, and Inventory screen that have items within.\nYou can now swap your Loadouts from the Solar Map \nLoadout descriptions are now viewable upon being hovered over.\nNumbers have been added to the Sanctuary's Practice Mastery Rank Tests so you know which test you're entering for practice of Qualification.\nWe have Updated the visuals of our Friends and Clan UI pages!

  "changes": "Octavia'S Anthem: Update 20:\n\n\nDo you hear the music, Tenno? Faint memories of the Mandachord orchestra linger, and Suda wishes you follow it. Do as the Cephalon requests and be rewarded knowledge of an instrument from another time, the Mandachord. But, take caution... following her instructions may lead you down a twisted path...\nVisit the Cephalon Suda Enclave in the Relay, and speak to Suda to start the quest. You must have the Second Dream quest completed to do so.\nOctavia’s Anthem is a replayable quest! If you would like to experience it again, visit your Codex and select “Replay Quest”.\n\n\n\nCompose her song and then conduct the mighty Mandachord, turning bass, beat and melody into an anthem of devastation.\nGet Octavia today by purchasing her in the Market for Platinum, or by completing Octavia’s Anthem to get her Blueprint. Her parts can be found in the following ways:\n\nConduct your very own symphony, Tenno. Octavia’s abilities are powered by the Mandachord, a formidable tool used to mix Melody, Bass, and Percussion into a harmony of destruction. Compose a song before entering the battle by going to your Arsenal, selecting the Appearance tab, and hitting the “Mandachord” button.\nIn this guide, we will be using the Adau Instruments to get you started on composition since they are the default Mandachord Instruments. There are also 4 other Instruments available in the Market for Platinum if you own Octavia:\nAlpha Instruments\nBeta Instruments\nDruk Instruments\nGamma Instruments\nEach Instrument is in the same key (D minor Pentatonic), so if you’re feeling adventurous try mixing and matching Instruments to create unique compositions.\nThe Mandachord is comprised of 4 bars which are represented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 (seen in the background of each bar). Placing one note at the start of each bar is a whole note. Each bar is divided into quarters which are represented by the vertical lines. The tempo is set to 120 beats per minute, meaning each bar is 2 seconds long, and each slot is a 16th note.\nThe fastest way to start your composition is to tackle the Percussion track first! Using the Adau Instruments, place the outer drum sound on every quarter note, the second drum sound on the first note of the first bar, and the third drum sound in the third slot of every quarter:\nSpoiler\n\nSpoiler\nYou will notice the pitch rises as you move towards the outer ring of the Mandachord. Each Instrument works this way, enabling your notes to sound at the same pitch with different Instruments. Other Instruments have different bass-only sounds for this section as well, so feel free to experiment.\n\n\nSpoiler\nYou can also form chords by placing notes together on the same beat!\nSpoiler\nSpoiler\n\nSpoiler\n\nTry maintaining the same Percussion throughout your composition.\nStart off by playing the lowest notes for the Bass in the first bar, and then increasing their pitch in each subsequent bar. Do the same for the Melody section. The key to getting good results is to slightly change the notes that are playing from bar to bar.\nThere are composition note limits:\nThe Bass track has a 16 note limit per composition.\nThe Melody track has a 16 note limit per composition.\nThe Percussion track has a 26 note limit per composition.\nUse the “Volume Mixer” to adjust the volume for each track.\nUse “Track Isolation” to toggle each track on and off.\nUse “Reload” to revert any new changes back to the original selected/saved song.\nDon’t forget to save your compositions into a song slot. You can save a total of 5 songs!\nUse “Load Song” to select one of your custom songs or one of the default Instrument songs to load into the Mandachord.\n\nIn order to send and receive songs, you must own Octavia.\nTyping [Song] in chat will bring up a list of your saved songs to chose from. Hovering your cursor over a song will play it for easy selection:\nSpoiler\nOnce you have selected a song to share, a link with its title will appear in chat for others to save. Clicking on a song link will give you the following instructions on how to load the song into your own Mandachord:\nSpoiler\nOnce you have the song loaded into your Mandachord, you are free to edit it. You can also save shared songs, but keep in mind the 5 song slot limit.\n\nShow off your favorite Warframe and Fashion ‘Frame with the new Captura feature. Use a vast array of tools to compose the perfect shot. Choose from numerous available locations, spawn in enemies, slow down, or speed up time and compose a stunning photograph. Add more depth to your composition with dozens of filters, special effects and graphic options.\nHead to the Arsenal and select your Warframe Appearance tab. There you will see a new button titled Captura on the bottom right. Upon launching Captura, you can select from the following Captura Scenes:\nCORPUS SHIP MAINTENANCE SCENE\nGRINEER GALLEON CARGO SCENE\nINFESTED SHIP HOLOGRAM SCENE\nEach Syndicate also offers their own themed Captura Scene, available at a Standing price. Interested in applying your own background scene or having a solid color background to your Captura images? Visit Simaris in the Relay to purchase the Color Key Scene for Standing. Teshin also has Conclave Scenes to offer, visit him the in the Relay to add these to your Captura Scene selection.\nBe sure to share your Captura screenshots with the Community\nwe can’t wait to see how creative you get! https://forums.warframe.com/topic/776648-update-20-share-your-captura-screenshots/\n\n\nA high tempo rifle. Choose between automatic and semi automatic fire to lay waste to your enemies. Its primary fire rewards increased accuracy and fire rate with consistent shooting. Its alt fire will load up 10 ammo before being shot in a single blow. The Tenora can be purchased in the Market for Platinum or researched in the Tenno Lab Dojo room.\nThis fan hammer pistol, like the Tenora, also has two firing modes. Its semi-automatic primary fire will please sharpshooters. Its alt fire packs a punch (several) by emptying its entire clip in one trigger pull, but hold steady, the shots also have some kick to them. The Pandero can be purchased in the Market for Platinum or you can purchase its Blueprint in the Market for crafting.\n\nAn alternate helmet for Wukong.\nAn alternate helmet for Octavia.\nAccentuate the Kavat’s sleek profile with this enchanting decorative armor!\nWho is this gangly creature on your Landing Craft?! Who let this malformed Infested inside?! KILL IT WITH FIR\noh wait, that’s the newly reskinned Helminth Charger! With a whole new look comes a new attitude.\nFor those of you looking for the original Charger model, you can find the Helminth Degenerate Pattern as a Cosmetic Option in the Market available for Credits!\nJavlok, Buzlok, Ferrox, Harpak, Hind, Mutalist Quanta, Penthera, Paracyst, Penta, Quanta (Vandal), Stradavar, Tenora, Zarr\nAzima, Euphona Prime, Kulstar, Pandero, Talons\n5 new emotes are available for your hip-shaking convenience!\nGlissade Narta\nMaestro Narta\nPoise Narta\nTempo Narta\nPendulum Narta\nThe Relays and Maroo’s Bazaar now offer dedicated music zones, where you can share your Mandachord compositions and boogie down with fellow Tenno. Simply bring Octavia to one of the areas marked with the symbol seen in the image below, and select any of the Narta emotes listed above to start the party.\n\nDojos have a “free for all” policy when it comes to sharing your Mandachord compositions. Team up with your Clan to create symphonies in the comfort of your own Dojo, without concern of getting a noise complaint.\nDojo sessions are now hosted using the Relay system!\nThis means that Dojo sessions will be no longer be handled with the Host and Client method, eliminating potential host migrations or other host-related connectivity issues. Clan members will be able to invite other Tenno to the Dojo and leave without forcing their invitees out as well.\nFor performance’s sake, the Instance limit for Relays also applies to this new system. You and 49 other Tenno will be able to visit the Dojo at the same time before another Instance is created, and any modifications done to the Dojo will still propagate across each Instance simultaneously.\nAs a result of these changes, “Host” will be removed from the Clan Roles list since any and all Clan members will now be able to access the Dojo at all times.\nTrading in the Dojo now works similarly to trading in the Maroo's Bazaar where players can \"set up shop\". The trading post still shows all players in the Dojo with trades remaining for the day, but Players can now start a trade from the Trading Post or by interacting with another Player who is in trading mode.\nDuelling will use the original Dojo hosting system, where it will create one session for the duelling Tenno. Players will be able to trade in the Duelling Room, but not during a Duelling Session.\nA new and improved Mastery Rank-Up screen is here! When you become eligible for a rank-up, a new option to initiate your test will appear at the top of the pause menu (instead of directly under your name). Upon selecting to start your test, a new screen appears that shows you what Mastery Rank test you’re about to attempt, what rewards you will receive upon a successful completion, and helpful hints!\nSee it in action: https://twitter.com/PabloPoon/status/839946792078831616\nIn addition to the Dojo hosting changes, Clan Affinity will be awarded depending on the amount of effort expended towards bettering one’s Clan. This Clan Affinity will contribute to the Clan’s Rank and is awarded as follows:\nThe first time you construct an Oracle Room, Bio Lab, Chem Lab, Energy Lab, Tenno Lab, Orokin Lab, Duelling Room and Obstacle Course.\nThe first time you construct a Trading Post, Treasury, and Temple of Honor.\nUpon completion of Clan Research.\nThe amount of Clan Affinity earned by building Rooms or Decorations are listed in their respective selection screens; Research entries have been given the same treatment within the Lab UI. A Research tab has also been added to the Clan Profile, which will list all research and its state of completion per Lab!\nDon’t worry if your Clan has already done all or part of the above tasks \nthe rewards are retroactive! The appropriate amount of Clan Affinity has been given to all existing Clans with this Update.\nAll existing Clans are currently at the initial Rank, regardless of their Clan Affinity. Once its members complete the Ascension Ceremony, the Clan will Ascend to the highest Clan Rank attainable with their current amount of Affinity.\nWhat is this Ascension Ceremony? If you have earned enough to reach the next Rank, a new Decoration called the Ascension Altar will become active! To participate in this Ceremony, a clan member simply needs to interact with this device. Depending on your Clan Tier, a certain number of members must partake in this ceremony in order to reach Ascension, but under no time limit.\nParticipants will immediately be awarded Endo upon interacting with the Altar, and any remaining Clan members will be able to interact with the Altar and receive an Endo reward within 72 hours after the Ascension Ceremony has been completed. Participants from Clans who have enough Clan Affinity to Ascend multiple Ranks will be rewarded with Endo from each individual Rank.\nThe required number of participants per Tier are as follows:\nGhost: 1\nShadow: 5\nStorm: 15\nMountain: 30\nMoon: 50\nThe amount of Endo awarded per Clan Rank is as follows:\nRank One: 1,000\nRank Two: 2,000\nRank Three: 3,000\nRank Four: 4,000\nRank Five: 5,000\nRank Six: 6,000\nRank Seven: 7,000\nRank Eight: 8,000\nRank Nine: 9,000\nFor Clans who have earned the current max Clan Affinity at the time of this update, completing the Ascension Ceremony will award each participant (and any other player who interacts with the Altar within 72 hours after its completion) with a grand total of 45,000!\nTo remove any confusion between these new Clan Ranks and the existing ones, Clan Hierarchy is now used to describe a player’s position within the Clan, whether they are a Warlord or an Initiate.\nAll of these changes are the foundation for a larger system planned for release later this year, so stay tuned, Tenno!\nSniper Crewman now are able to deploy mini-robots known as Ratel. These fast-moving mini robotics units are quick and can quickly overwhelm even the strongest Tenno \ntake them out at the source!\nWe have increased the spawn chance of Sniper Crewman in Corpus missions. We have also reduced the spawn chance of Sapping Ospreys (which will mean less Sapper Mines) and lowered the maximum allowable simultaneous instances of Sapping Ospreys.\nBow and Sniper lovers rejoice! A new strategy for annihilating Nullifiers is now available. Nullifier backpacks are now equipped with Projector Drones that are deployed overhead. These Projector Drones are the power source behind the Nullifiers’ bubbles, and determine the growth, size, and vitality of the bubble. Here is what you can expect from the Nullifiers’ updated backpacks:\nWhen alerted for the first time, Nullifiers will deploy their Projector Drone to create a bubble.\nWhen in contact with varying ceiling heights, the Projector Drone will adjust its own height and reduce the size of the bubble to remain targetable.\nIf the bubble has been popped, the Projector Drone will return to the backpack for a brief period of time before being deployed again.\nIf the Projector Drone is destroyed, the bubble will pop and render the Nullifier permanently unable to make bubbles.\nProjector Drone health scales with enemy level.\nFixed Nullifiers so that stealth finisher targets don’t grow the bubble, as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/765409-bug-with-nullifiers-and-stealth-kills\nThe World State Window now has progressive disclosure and will only display the missions and Categories for content in which a player has met the criteria. Some of this is partially in place, but this is a more exhaustive change that ensures new players are not overwhelmed by seeing content they cannot play.\nAlerts will only appear in the World State Window if you have the planet unlocked.\nInvasions will only show if you have the planet unlocked.\nSorties will only become visible after completing The War WIthin.\nSyndicate Daily Missions only appear if a player is a member of a Syndicate.\nVoid Fissures will not appear until a player obtains their first Relic\nLimbo is a Warframe with one of the most complicated skillsets. When his skills are mastered, he becomes an unstoppable force of Rift manipulation. While many have perfected the Limbo, there's been a general sense he needs to be revisited to make the mastering feel more rewarding.\nWith this Update, we have revisited Limbo.  Changes to Limbo include the following:\nWhile in the Rift, Limbo receives a slight Energy regeneration. Additionally, enemies killed in the Rift will grant Limbo 10 Energy.\nLimbo darts in and out of different Planes of existence at no Energy cost. Tapping the roll key (default binding Shift) will shift Limbo between the Rift and Material Plane. Shifting into the Rift leaves behind a tear that, for a brief period of time (5s), Limbo and Allies can use it to enter the Rift. Limbos that enter the Rift through the tear can remain in the Rift as long as they please, unlike Allies who have temporary access.\nSend enemies and Allies within a small radius into or out of the Rift for a period of time. Banish targets must be in the same Plane as Limbo to be affected. For example, Limbo must be in the Material Plane to Banish Material Plane targets to the Rift and vice versa. Banished enemies will take damage when casted and will be knocked down for a brief period of time.\nStop Banished enemies in their tracks by putting them in Stasis for a period time. Toggle the ability on and move within the Rift to strategically set up shots around enemies affected by Stasis. Projectiles will stay suspended until the Stasis timer runs out, until toggled off, or until the 300 projectile limit has been reached, upon which your torrent of projectiles will be launched at the enemy.\nVoid energy surges through Limbo and into the Rift, charging enemies within it. Charged enemies that cross over to the Material Plane will Banish themselves and nearby enemies back into the Rift. When charged enemies die outside of the Rift, they surge and transfer the charge to nearby enemies.\nBridging the Rift and Material Planes, Cataclysm creates a sphere of Void Energy that shifts enemies within its radius into the Rift. During its creation and final collapse, enemies stumble and take damage. The sphere’s final collapse deals damage to enemies both in and out of the sphere, and scales based on the health and shields of ALL enemies in the Rift.\nMission objective items, such as Datamass, can now be carried in and out of the Rift Plane. However! Be careful not to drop these items in the Rift Plane, as they can only be picked up in the Material Plane.\nAllies in Cataclysm's sphere can now collect pickups including mission objective items.\nThe Rift Torrent Augment Mod will now grant Limbo a damage increase (15/20/25/30%) for every enemy affected by Rift Surge and has had it’s description changed to reflect this.\nToned down the FX while in the Rift.\nAs we near the staggering number of 300 weapons (including variants), the task of balancing grows increasingly daunting. At its core, Warframe is a co-operative game; having powerful tools is a boon to a team rather than a disadvantage. However, there are a few weapons that have such a dominating effect in missions that co-operative missions essentially become solo. Aside from the handful of dominating weapons, there are even more that have been overlooked.\nThe Miter is one of the oldest examples of killer concept with lackluster results. The next Update will bring the following:\nIncreased chance of dismemberment on kills.\nIncreased speed of Projectiles.\nCharge time has been halved.\nCritical Chance of 5% for a quick shot.\nCritical Chance of 10% for a charged shot.\nHit detection is now based on the size of the Sawblade.\nMastery Rank increased to 6.\nThe Harpak's stats aren't the worst in the scheme of Primaries, but it has received some love since it is often overlooked.\nRecoil has been reduced on the Primary Fire.\nThe Alt-Fire Charge time has been removed \nit is now an instant harpoon.\nThe Critical Chance has been increased to 20%.\nIncreased the range of the Alt-Fire from 15 meters to 40 meters.\nIncreased the flight speed of the Alt-Fire and updated the FX.\nAdjusted pull strength of the Harpak’s alt fire to have enemies more likely to end up near you.\nThe Hind has more nicknames than most Primaries (Baguette, etc), but not as much use.\nWe've added a single-shot Semi-Auto Alt Fire to the Hind that has increased Damage, Critical, and Status Chance.\nLike the Miter, the Panthera is a killer idea with lackluster execution. We've made the following changes:\nPrimary Fire has been switched to Automatic, and the fire rate has been increased.\nThe Status Chance of Primary Fire has been increased to 20%\nCritical Hit Chance of Primary Fire is now 10%\nThe Critical Multiplier is now 2x.\nAmmo Requirement is reduced to 2.\nSecondary Fire Status chance is now 35%\nCritical hit Chance of Secondary is now 25%\nHit detection is now based on the size of the projectile.\nMastery Rank is now 7.\nThe Paracyst is one of the more spine-tingling weapons in the Arsenal that really runs with the Infested theme.\nThe damage of the Primary Fire has been increased by 5.\nUpdated the FX of the projectiles of the Primary Fire.\nIncreased the range of the Alt-Fire tether to 50 m.\nThe Status Chance of the Primary and Secondary Fire has been increased to 30%\nThe Critical Chance of Primary Fire has been increased to 10%\nMastery Rank is now 5.\nThe Mutalist Quanta is getting more of a mechanic change rather than just stats.\nIt will have its Alt-Fire stack similar to the Simulor to make a large Infested Orb that you can shoot through for additional stats.\nThe Buzlok and its homing mechanism has been used for many creative moments \nbut ultimately this weapon has been overlooked.\nThe Ammo Requirement for the Secondary Homing has been reduced to 2.\nPhysical Damage distribution has been adjusted to 50% Impact, 40% Puncture, and 10% Slash.\nDamage has been increased to 60 from 45.\nCritical Chance increased to 15%\nCritical Damage increased to 2.5x\nThe flight speed of the Homing Beacon has been increased.\nThe Homing Beacon will now only stick to NPC & Characters.\nCritical Chance increased by 50% on targets with Homing Beacon attached to them.\nClip size reduced to 50.\nMastery Rank increased to 9.\nThe Ice Beam weapon: the Glaxion. Probably one of the most exciting weapons to imagine in combat, yet it has received a cold reception.\nCold Damage has increased to 333 from 250.\nThe rate at which ammo is consumed has been decreased.\nIncreased the Accuracy of the Glaxion.\nReduced the range from 30 meters to 24 meters.\nThe Ogris has gone through a visual Upgrade, and now it's time for a stat upgrade. To many, this was their first entry into Launcher weapons \nare you willing to give it another look?\nThe Flight Speed of the projectile has been increased.\nThe Status Chance has been increased to 35%.\nThe charge time to fire the Ogirs has been reduced.\nThe direct Impact damage of the projectile has been decreased to 100.\nAoE damage has increased to 600.\nAoE range has increased to 6 meters.\nMastery Rank requirement has increased to 8.\nThe Attica was the debut entry into Automatic Primary Crossbows! We've revisited it to perhaps bring it back into the spotlight of your Arsenal.\nThe Weapon Recoil has been reduced.\nThe Fire Rate has been increased.\nThe Flight Speed of the bolts has increased.\nThe Critical Chance has increased to 25%.\nThe Critical Multiplier has increased to 2x.\nThe Ammo Capacity has increased to 20.\nWe have nerfed 3 weapons (plus 1 variant)  that we feel disrupts the co-op setting and pace of gameplay for most groups:\nThe Tonkor's rocket jumping mechanic has long been obsolete since the introduction of bullet jumping, so the Tonkor now deals self-damage like all other launchers.\nThe Tonkor Grenade trajectory line now appears on holding the fire button (Default Left Mouse), and grenade fires on release.\nThe grenade needs to travel 6m before arming itself, it will bounce off yourself, other players and AI before then.\nThe Maximum lifespan of grenade has dropped from 5 to 3 seconds \ngrenades are quicker to explode\nGrenades bounce lower and explode sooner, making them more likely to explode where they are shot.\nThe Critical Chance has been reduced to 25%.\nThe Accuracy of the Tonkor has been increased.\nThe Simulor's entry into Arsenals marked one of the more unique moments in Weapon history. It's always been a little weird \nstacking orbs together leads to both passive and active death. The stacking itself causes damage and the fully stacked orb can be activated with your 'Alt Fire' button for an additional explosion.\nThe Status Chance has been increased to 30%.\nThe amount of Orbs required to make a full stack has decreased \nit used to take 5, now it takes 3.\nA Critical Chance of 2% has been added.\nThe AoE Explosion range (based on stack when expires or manual detonation) increased from 0.5-2.8 meters to 1-6 meters.\nThe Explosion Damage has increased from 50 per orb to 75 (225 at full stack).\nOn an orb stacking event (when orbs combine), damage range decreased to 1-6 from 3-8\nOn an orb stacking event, damage decreased from 150-250 to 20-40\nThe Simulor has had its max Ammo Capacity reduced to 60.\nConsidering the Simulor was the only Primary Cephalon weapon, it was easy to see a Synoid version entering Arsenals. Like its vanilla counterpart, it's always been a little weird \nstacking orbs together leads to both passive and active death. The stacking itself causes damage and the fully stacked orb can be activated with your 'Alt Fire' button for an additional explosion.\nThe Status Chance increased to 35%\nThe amount of Orbs required to make a full stack has decreased \nit used to take 5, now it takes 4.\nA Critical Chance of 5% has been added.\nThe AoE Explosion range (based on stack when expires or manual detonation) increased from 0.5-2.8 meters to 1-8 meters.\nThe Explosion Damage has increased from 50 per orb to 75 (300 at full stack).\nOn an orb stacking event (when orbs combine), damage range decreased to 1-8 from 3-8\nOn an orb stacking event, damage decreased from 150-250 to 20-50\nThe Synoid Simulor has had its max Ammo Capacity reduced to 75.\nThe only melee entry on the list is the Telos Boltace.\nThis weapon is receiving a bit more of a mechanic change rather than a purely numerical change.\nThe Slide attack will create a vortex that staggers and draws enemies toward you.\nThe following Slide attack (after a vortex) will radial blast and ragdoll enemies away from you.\nThis 'back and forth' will be on a cooldown.\nIf you have invested into a nerfed weapon, when the Update releases there will be an Inbox message generated on Login to give you a single 3 day Affinity Booster and a Forma per owned weapon to reconfigure your weapons as you see fit!\nRegarding any Rivens you may have or are looking to pick up for any of the listed weapons: you can expect small changes to stats. Stay tuned for more information in the Update notes!\nFixed the Tether Grenade Mod for the Penta cancelling Self Damage.\nThere is now a toggle option for how you want to fly: old vs. new! This option allows players to switch between the original Archwing flight system that we introduced vs the newer one we added. You can find this in the Options menu by going to Controls > Archwing > Toggle Experimental Flight!\nRemoved unusable Ammo Drops from Archwing.\nImproved the radius and 'suck speed' of Archwing's innate vacuum.\nThe Vulkar Wraith is now tradable!\nEmotes no longer remain active while changing your Arsenal in the Relay.\nFocus Convergence Orbs will now spawn closer to you \nbefore they would spawn within 40 to 80 meters, now they will spawn within 30 to 60 meters.\nThe Judgement points required to enter the various Rathuum missions and to fight Kela de Thaym on Merrow have been reduced!

This node is optional, and is not required to complete Neptune. Since Endurance modes play out with no explicit end, we've made all Index enemies drop all Index exclusive modes so that you can remain in the same Endurance mission without missing out on drops that the enemies don't spawn.\nDecreased the hit box on the Grineer Rollers to better match the visual mesh.\nReduced particles from the Telos Boltace slide attack as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/764794-balance-the-telos-boltace/?page=2#comment-8431700\nRe-arranged Stims to appear together in Dojo Research.\nAdded mini-map marker for Dojo Transporter.\nRemoved bounding boxes of Dojo and Orbiter Decorations, except around Triggerable or Interactive sections of Decorations.

A distance label is also added to this Marker (but will disappear when they are being revived).\nImproved visuals of Grineer Blunt.\nChanged translations on Resource Drone extract button to be singular if only 1 Extractor is ready.\nTweaked the location of a Kuria in the Shipyards!\nThe objective count in Mobile Defense missions will now disappear a couple seconds after all objectives have been successfully completed.\nUpdated Sargas Ruk’s face with wrinkle data so that you can see his anger in all of its wrinkled glory.\nChanged the console action text and its marker to hover over the console screen instead of floating above it in the first mission of Vor’s Prize.\nAdded extra navigation Marker in first mission of Vor’s Prize to make path clearer.\nUpdated the Corpus Turret animations for performance improvements.\nChoosing the default Ash skin for Ash Prime now removes all Ash Prime details.\nImproved cloth physics on several Sugatras (Boloket Sugatra, Scyth Sugatra, Ki'Teer Sugatra, and the Tentacyst Sugatra).\nOptimized numerous Dojo decorations for improved performance.\nImproved AI navigation in a number of Infested Salvage tiles.\nAdded PBR touches to a number of Corpus art objects.\nAdded PBR touches to a number of Dojo art objects.\nAdded PBR touches to numerous Infested Hive art objects.\nAdjusted the difficulty scaling of the Spy Mission portion of Vor’s Prize Quest.\nUpdated a number of Warframe Skin icons to make them all more consistent.\nLowered the specular lightning on the Smeeta Kavat to address ‘plastic’ looking issues.\nImproved the loading times of certain HUD elements.\nAdjusted the lighting in the Perrin Sequence Lunaro map.\nImproved the dual wielding functionality of Sentient enemy types.\nAdded additional Relay flavor NPCs.\nPerformed a lighting pass on the Infested Corpus tileset for improved reflection fidelity.\nDisabled the mini-map during the mountain pass section of The War Within quest.\nTweaked the visuals of the trade offering icon shown above player’s heads during the trade process.\nTweaked the visual appearance of a number of Infested coral art objects.\nUpdated the wrinkle maps seen on the faces of Grineer Marines.\nThe recruiting channel can now be joined while in a PvP lobby.\nImprove the spawning logic of interactive consoles in Mobile Defense matches to ensure a better spread.\nMagnetize used by enemy NPC Mag’s will now have a 1 second delay before the actual ability is deployed to prevent players from instantly 1-shotting themselves when facing these enemies.\nChanged flashing reticule hitmaker to be simulated locally for Clients to provide better visual damage feedback if they have a poor connection to Host.\nFixed an issue with the flashing reticule hitmaker when jumping or Bullet Jumping near enemies.\nFixed an issue with the flashing reticule hitmaker during Vauban’s Vortex, and Nezha’s Blazing Chakram and Warding Halo.\nUpdated NPC idle animations.\nChanged the tints on the default shader for the Latron as it was all dark, and not fitting the icon!\nThe Corpus Ship Tileset has received an ambiance overhaul.\nNote from George the Audio Director: “We wanted to give this tileset an audio refresh because most of the sounds were created over 3 years ago. In that time we have come up with tech that lets us play ambient sounds in a more realistic way and in a way that makes the levels feel more alive. In addition to the new tech, we also created a lot of new sounds that are unique to this tileset, in order to make it feels more Corpus-like.”\nPuzzle push-volumes now affect Warframes with knockdown immunity (Iron Skin, Warding Halo).\nReduced the MASHED Glyph diorama lighting in the Market to improve visibility.\nMade some adjustments to the Invincibility marker in the HUD so that it is more legible.\nRemoved Corpus Ship room that was unintentionally included in the Corpus Outpost tileset.\nImproved melee weapon holster transition animation for the customizable hostler positions to fix snapping.\nMade several optimizations for Relay performance.\nLowered the brightness on Excalibur's Blind cast and Drone Explosion deaths to avoid excessive bloom.\nNavigation panel information (not quest related) will now be hidden when playing through Vor's Prize.\nGrineer Helmets have been given the PBR treatment to better match their bodies!\nLowered the camera level when in the Archwing Arsenal to better view your Warframe.\nChanged Rhino’s Roar to only buff non-Tenno allies with a weapon -\nthis avoids the confusion when things like the Defense pod would suddenly start glowing strangely when near a Roar.\nUpdated the icons for the Chroma Drevni and Chroma Vojnik skins to include shots of the default Helmet (with the skin colours applied) to resolve confusion.\nChanged the Hostage/Rescue Target's in-world marker border from white to blue to match the icon color.\nImproved scaling and offset of items when viewing them in the Codex.\nChanged Atlas' Rumblers HUD marker from objective to Allied NPC.\nChanged Grineer Galleon tiles used during the Nav Segment phase of Vor’s Prize to show off a more visually interesting/less confusing route.\nCorpus Ship and Infested Ship door caps are now off instead of red.\nTweaked Mesa’s Noble Rifle animation to remove a pop in the movement.\nThe Braton Prime, Braton Vandal, Aklato, Lato Prime, and Lato Vandal have all had their firing sounds remastered!\nYou will now continue to be in a crouched position when jumping while crouching.\nWe have made some changes that largely affect the duration of Lunaro matches. These are very fast paced games \nand the new win scenarios speak to that!\nLunaro match time has been reduced to 6 minutes from 10 minutes. These means there will be two 3 minute halves.\nThe Maximum score has been reduced to 20: first team to 20 points wins!\n\nConclave Mods Final Act and Tactical Retreat now have a full screen effect when activated.\nConclave Mod Final Act changed to: +30% Ability Strength and +30% Casting Speed for 4 seconds when health drops below 50.\nEffects indicating that a player is immune to Knockdown and Impair have been made more clear in Conclave.\n \nOro is now automatically received from melee kills in Conclave.\nReduced the brightness of surface lighting in the Canyon Settlement map, added in new lighting system, and other lighting fixes.\nAdjusted lighting intensity to make team FX indicators more readable.\nAdjusted Oberon’s Hallowed Ground to have a more visually obvious edge that can be seen in bright environments.\nHydroid's passive now has 100% chance in Conclave, with its duration reduced to 6 seconds.\nAsh’s passive in Conclave changed to Bleed debuff from hits with weapons from the Nikana family.\nTrinity’s passive in Conclave changed to increase Shield Recharge Rate for her and her teammates within 25m.\nEnergy regen rate of Ember’s Passive reduced in Conclave.\nRemoved damage bonus from Mesa's Shooting Gallery in Conclave.\nNyx's Psychic Daggers now only seek target under reticule.

For those with a fully 7-day matured Helminth Cyst, the individual permanent cure awaits you in the Helminth Infirmary. The completion of Glast Gambit is not required to have your Helminth Cyst removed, and once the cure has been administered that Warframe will not be granted access back into the room and can no longer be infected. Keep in mind that breeding a Helminth Charger requires a mature Helminth Cyst to be drained\nthe choice is yours!\nWithout spoiling too much, we have a script incoming that fixes and applies the proper Alignment choices made in The Glast Gambit between the window of Dec 22 9am ET and Dec 23 10am ET. Further investigation from reports showed that ‘Moon’ choices gave a ‘Neutral’ outcome and vice versa during this window (was later fixed).\nWe will update this post when the script has finished!\nScript is complete! Alignment has been corrected for those in the affected time window.\nNidus, Ash Koga Profile and Frost Harka Icons have been added to the Market for purchase!\nAdded controller shake to Titania’s Razorwing ability.\n",
  "changes": "The Glast Gambit: Update 19.6.0:\nIncreased the base health of Nidus’ Maggots to 1k.\nIncreased Nidus’ Mutation Stack consumption from 10 to 15 when knocked into a bleedout state/death. The task of regaining 10 Stacks is quickly obtainable, making this consequence for dying too light. Although 15 Stacks is not a huge jump, we’re hoping it’s closer to that sweet spot! \nEntering a Nullifier bubble will now drain down Mutation Stacks the longer you are in the bubble. \nTo increase the visibility of Nidus' Maggots, holding down Nidus’ Virulence will now display a HUD marker on them. Keep in mind that casting Virulence on Maggots cause them to detonate!\nNidus’ Ravenous Maggots no longer auto detonate when feasting on enemies. Previously the Maggots could do a majority of the grunt work and you were able to watch the carnage and gain Stacks at the same time. Now to pop the Maggots you’ll need to cast Virulence on them and rejoice in your hard earned Stack accumulation. It’s also worth noting that with testing by our team, the Stack rhythm before and after this change wasn’t noticed at all. \nImproved the FX of Maggot explosion to better represent the intended area of explosion.\nNidus’ Ravenous Maggots will still attack but no longer latch on other Infested Maggots or Kuva Jesters due to awkward animations.  \nFixed FX, Maggots, & Health regeneration while in Ravenous staying around forever if cast by a Client who leaves.\nUpdated and improved the look of Frost’s abilities with fancy new ice textures! \nFurther optimized network access to help alleviate ‘Network Not Responding’ issues.\nPlayers who have reached the Riven Mod capacity can now continue to trade Riven Mods as long as the trade does not result in going over the capacity.\nIn an effort to address the issue of people not noticing the movement of The Kuva Fortress, we have made the loop completion time odd rather than a 24 hour cycle. Players who were logging in around the same daily time found that the Kuva Fortress would always be roughly in the same position, and was restricting the variety of Kuva Siphon missions available.\nWhen not connected to Steam and viewing a TennoGen item, the price will now read ‘Workshop Item’ instead of ‘$0.00’. \nChanged ‘Tenno’ to ‘allies’ in the Cat’s Eye Mod description. \nTweaked Nova Asuri Collection description to clarify that the arm/hands FX is not part of the Danavi Syandana, but on cast of Nova’s powers. \nRemoved ability to see Codex information about Relics you do not own. \nRemoved ability to purchase multiple Arcane Distillers from Syndicates since they are now no longer consumed on use.\nVulkar and Vulkar Wraith are now usable in Conclave!\nImpair on hit status removed from Opticor in Conclave.\nTeshin’s Conclave Affinity Inbox message will no longer open automatically. This was resulting in Conclave Affinity being claimed and lost if you were maxed out.\nFixed a tileset hole in the Celestial Ruins Conclave tileset.\n",

Ash enters target mode, which you can freely target enemies with your reticule up to 3 times each for attack. Once you're satisfied, press 4 again, Blade Storm begins and all targeted enemies are attacked!\nEach mark costs Energy (15) which is affected by Mods. If a marked enemy is killed by a squad mate, you will get the energy back. \nMarks made while invisible by any source will have a cheaper base cost (10). \nEnemies killed by Blade Storm will dissolve, leaving no corpse behind to detect!\nTeleport will now allow you to target anything with a health bar! Instead of being limited to Teleporting to allies or enemies, you can now teleport to objects.\nSmoke Screen can now be cast while running (no lower body movement lock).\nSmoke Screen can now be cast while in-air!\nSpoiler\nEndo (2K) \nEndo (4K) \nSpoiler\nRiven Mod\nLens/Greater Lenses\nOrokin Reactor/Catalyst Blueprint\nExilus Adaptor Blueprint\nLegendary Core\nSpoiler\nSpoiler\nRiven Mod \nEndo (4K) \nEndo (2K) (radically lowered drop chance and spread across new additions) \n3 Day Booster \nLens/Greater Lens\n3 Nitain\nForma\nOrokin Reactor/Catalyst Blueprint\nExilus Adaptor Blueprint\nLegendary Core\nPlease note regarding these changes that we took the large 2000 Endo chances and chopped/reassigned to give a more diverse set of options to have variety of other rewards. We are aiming to make the full drop table more broadly appealing. When The War Within launched, we added Rivens to Sorties as a common drop to be the new, interesting, and unique evergreen goal for players in Sorties.  Rivens remain common with these changes as we see them as the ultimate goal for Sorties. Regarding Nitain specifically, the majority of our recently active players have less than 9 Nitain in their accounts and there is considerable interest in some new ways to acquire, so we are trying out Sorties as an option. A next step here is being considered to add a completely new Ayatan in the place of 2K Endo to give collectors and Endo hunters something to look forward to.\n10x Kavat Genetic Codes have been added to Alerts!\nDoubled the length of rare-item Alerts!\nSortie Rewards are now displayed in color by rarity. \nValkyr Prime, Cernos Prime, and Venka Prime have been added to the Codex and are now linkable in chat. \nThe Kuva Fortress is now eligible for Grineer Sortie mission locations. \nYou can now change firing modes during reload on the Stradavar and Zarr as per feedback:\nOptimized Holster customization. \nMade some changes to lower level load time in some cases in the Kuva Fortress.\nReduced the range in which waypoint markers will display in the HUD in The Jordas Verdict to reduce distraction when maneuvering through the tunnels. \nFixed a progression stopping bug where the esophage wouldn’t consume the vape if the Host is outside or downed/dead in The Jordas Verdict. \nFixed being able to fly through J3 Jordas Golem in The Jordas Verdict. \nFixed seeing squadmates distance displayed on the HUD after they’ve entered the tunnel in The Jordas Verdict. \nFixed failing The Jordas Verdict if a player goes through an esophage at the same time a nerve is destroyed.\nFixed The Jordas Verdict cinematic animating players below the level. \nFixed a flickering shield effect on the J3 Jordas Golem in The Jordas Verdict.\nAdded a confirmation message when trying to leave as a Client at End of Mission by pressing ESC to avoid unintended quits. \nReduced the damage of Cernos Prime in Conclave.\nHalikar disarm chance is now 100% in Conclave.\n",

The Queens' Fortress awaits, where both Warframe and Operator will be pushed past their limits as they slowly unravel mysteries about the Tenno’s past and their true capabilities.\nThe next chapter to 'The Second Dream' has arrived. Knowing what the Tenno are is just the beginning of your story. It is time to face The War Within.\nHow to access this Quest: If you've completed the Sedna Junction, you will receive this quest immediately on login via Inbox message.\nIf you do not receive The War Within Quest upon login be sure to have the Second Dream Quest and Sedna Junction completed. An inbox message will automatically appear once you have done so.\nOnce you've progressed far enough in The War Within to discover The Kuva Fortress, a new region will appear on your Solar Chart!\nPlay through and experience some of our most difficult and heavily fortified missions yet.\nWith this set, we knew we wanted to provide an awe-inspiring entry into the world of the Grineer Queens and Kuva. This set is complete with the latest in graphics enhancements like Volumetric Lighting, and includes some of the first ever Archwing Enemy incorporation into foot missions. Don't forget to aim up, Tenno.\nNew Music can be discovered while playing these missions, Keith Power brings us his creepiest compositions to date!\nThere comes a new way to obtain power \nfinish the War Within to receive your first entry. More information is out there… if you can find it.\nAfter you complete The War Within, Kuva Siphons may appear on Hard Grineer Environments (Sedna, Kuva Fortress, Uranus). These are side-quests related to the larger goals of the Grineer Empire. You will encounter new enemies here, and be required to use the skills learned in The War Within to prevail.\n\nFourth and fifth weapons exist… but defeating The War Within will be necessary to discover them.\nFrost & Frost Prime now have cloth physics! For years our favourite Master of Ice has had a rather static cloak, but no more! \nSolo Mode missions now start after just 5 seconds! \nDecorator Mode is now here for Dojos and Landing Crafts!

  "changes": "Warframe Update 19: The War Within:\n'Finally it's here' the developers and players said in unison with tears (of joy?) in their eyes! When traditional developers pen their open letters at launch, it's often the last step after months or years of development. It's often a sign-off to address the people who are about to dive into the finished work of a collective group. But Warframe is far from traditional and our work is never done.\nThe War Within is here on PC! This is the next chapter in the story of Warframe. What we set out to do always seems a little wild in hindsight, but it's the thrill and ambition of storytelling that drives us to challenge ourselves and you. We want to grow and change Warframe in interesting ways. We're presenting you another chapter of growth today.\nThis chapter tells a story of your patience, our gratitude, and of course some wonderful evolution for the game. We're introducing an awe inspiring and dangerous environment: the Kuva Fortress. We're pushing our engine technology to bring you graphic improvements. We're bringing you a story about your past.\nThe War Within is also a reflection of lessons for us on how to feed, respect, and tame the growing animal that is Warframe. This update's name has outgrown itself and it represents something bigger. If you asked any of us 4 years ago what we expected to happen with this project, none of us would believe you if you showed us this day.\nWe are beyond lucky to have hard working people at Digital Extremes to bring this chapter of Warframe to life. We are grateful to have you to share it with.\nThank you Tenno. We hope you enjoy another Update that's free from us to you.\n\nEver since the change to the new Solar Chart in Specters of the Rail, the Invasion system hasn't exactly been exciting or novel. The War Within brings some much needed freshness to this part of the game!\nPrior Sortie Season Vandal and Wraith rewards can now be offered as invasion rewards by the respective faction. \nInterception missions have been added into the mix when playing for invading faction.\nWinning factions will now 'Occupy' the node for up to 24 hours. During this period, the invaders will raid the location for resources towards a mysterious 'Construction Project'\nThe mission type at a particular Invasion node will change every 15 minutes.\nThe progress of an invasion can now lead to a Faction Specific event! Watch closely as the Grineer and Corpus gather enough strength!\nFactions now pay an additional 1000 Credits each time you run a mission for them on the same node (up to max of 10K).\nFixed issues with Invasion missions loading to black and no spawning enemies. \nFixed Invasion progress not counting if a player was in mission during a Hotfix. \nFixed Phorid occupied nodes still showing the underlying bosses.\nSorties were introduced in The Second Dream. They originally launched with 'Seasons' that rotated with set rewards. Since launch we iterated in several ways, including adding repeatable/non-repeatable rewards and more. Now we bring you more change with The War Within: Sortie Seasons are no more. We now have a set reward list of rewards that are always repeatable.\nThe new pre-requisite to access Sorties is completion of The War Within. \nNezha Parts have moved to the Tenno Lab in player Dojos. \nVandal and Wraith weapon parts have moved to the Invasion System as rewards for their respective factions. \nSortie Rewards are now set as:\nVarious Endo Amounts\nOrokin Catalyst\nOrokin Reactor\nExilus Adapter\nA random Focus Lens\nLegendary Core\n1 new item coming soon (see below)!\nThere is a new addition to Sortie rewards, but this will be revealed upon completion of The War Within.\nInterception, Defense, Survival, and Excavation Endless Void Fissure Missions have been revamped and now function in a new way!\nFirst, every reward interval can have it's own Relic selected and opened (if you get enough Reactant per interval).\nSecondly, the reward intervals are as follows (for clarity):\nDefense: 5 Waves.\nInterception: 1 Round.\nSurvival: 5 Minutes.\nExcavation: 200 Cryotic.\nShould you collect the necessary Reactant per interval and open your Relic, a bonus will occur and you will be allowed to re-select a new Relic for the next interval!

Today we're eager to introduce a community driven experiment within the Sentinel class. This is not the final book in this conversation, just the beginning.\nWe've also mentioned Kubrow/Kavat are not off the table. What we want to do is measure. We know where Carrier sits in usage compared to the rest of the options. We want a calculated release of a change that will deliver on giving Sentinels the function of Vacuum, and see how it affects the usage of content in that category. The results are something we'll be sharing as it should be very interesting to everyone invested in this particular topic. The shovel in the ground on this will apply to Sentinels first, but Pets aren't off the table.\nWe're starting with Sentinels to have this contained group of content analyzed. We will be keeping a close eye on how all of you feel about the new vacuum as well as looking at metrics to see how the distribution of sentinel usage changes across the community (right now 80% of you use Carrier)! We will share results along the way as a team, as soon as this Friday on Devstream #81!\nCarrier’s precept has been automatically changed to Ammo Case \nnow increases ammunition capacity and converts ammo pickups into ammo for the currently equipped weapon after a short delay.\n\n\n\nResearch it in the Tenno Lab or find it in the Market today!\n",

Sculptures, which are more valuable, can be completed by socketing in the appropriate types of Stars.\nMaroo will pay handsomely in Endo for your Ayatan treasures, but she’ll offer more for completed Sculptures. You’ll have to decide whether you want a quick payout or wait for the big prize and complete your Sculpture. If Endo isn’t what you desire most, you can keep your collection on display in your Landing Craft or trade your treasures with other Tenno.\nFinding Ayatan treasures in regular missions will be rare, but if you’re feeling adventurous, you can speak with Maroo for a special weekly treasure hunt mission that will test your coordination, speed, and mobility. If you enjoy the more leisurely approach to art collecting, you can always have other Tenno do the work for you and acquire your treasure through the trade system. Whatever your method of procurement, once you have a piece of Ayatan treasure, what you do with it will be up to you.\n\nThe Void is now an eligible region for Alerts! Alerts that occur in the Void will have a chance to include Void Traces as a reward!\n\nEndo rewards in Alerts now scale to enemy level, with values of 80,100, and 150 Endo for Easy / Medium / Hard enemies!\n\nYou can now select (opt-in to) a ‘Wait For Players’ option when a quickmatch session is not found.\n\nThe Top 20 winners from the Codex Art Contest 3.0 have been added (more to come)!\n",

GLYPH is now the catch-all word for Profile Pictures, so you'll see your Glyph selection determine that and your Forum Profile!\nIf you're asking yourself 'Where are my Fusion Cores and what is Endo?\", please read this section carefully! This section explains the conversion from a Fusion Core / Duplicate Mod fusion system to the Endo Fusion system.\nFusion in Warframe is one of the main systems that encourages investment in your Mod collection and Upgrading your gear. With calculated clicking and collecting, you can take your unranked Mods to top tier performers.\nWith the change to an Endo system we've removed the hidden complexity of Fusion. This Endo Fusion system maintains many aspects of the hold.\nWhat is Endo? Endo is Fusion energy incarnate. It is the raw resource that powers the process of Upgrading Mods. In essence, Endo serves as the simplifier in all things Fusion. All duplicate Mods can now be simply converted into Endo. Endo will now drop from enemies and missions where Fusion Cores used to be.\nFusing with Endo makes the Mod Rank increases clear, as the system now only increases in whole Ranks. Partial upgrading with unclear requirements towards your next rank will no longer exist, and neither will wasted Fusion energy. The UI will tell you exactly how much Endo is needed for the next Rank, which gives you a clear goal to work toward.\nAny partial Mod upgrades before this Update will be refunded with equivalent Endo and Credits.\nTreasures: discoverable ancient valuables that can be constructed and converted into high Endo quantities. \nTrading of Endo (in the form of Treasures).\nAdded Rarity colour grading to the Relic Reward selection screen in Fissure missions. \nSoft launch of colourblind door symbols! These new symbols should help you determine if a door is locked or unlocked, as they no longer rely on the sole use of colour. \nAdded a warning message when the last member of an Alliance’s creator Clan tries to dissolve the Clan. \nAdded indicators in the Arsenal of how many Forma are installed in gear, and whether or not gear has been fully Mastered! \nAdded a waypoint marker for Cephalon Fragments. \nAdded more Relic Rewards into Rotation A in replacement of some Credit Bundles and Mods.\n",

In an effort to address your concerns and increase the overall playability of the mode we've implemented a number of new gameplay features, arenas, customizations, and back end systems. Read on below for further details:\nNew Conclave weapon skins for the following weapons can now be purchased for standing from Tehsin once you’ve acquired the Typhoon rank:\nHaven't played any Lunaro since launch? Feeling a bit rusty? Well worry no more! The introduction of the new Lunaro Warm-Up system will take players currently waiting in a not full lobby and load them all into a practice session. These sessions will see all active players equipped with their own Lunaro so as to allow everyone the chance to practise basic game mechanics while waiting for additional loadings to join. Once a game is full and ready to begin the match will naturally progress to the proper Lunaro mode with goals, assists, and saves from the previous Warm-Up being wiped clear.\nMuch of the feedback we've received from our seasoned PvP players and newcomers alike was our inscrutable matchmaking rules. We've attempted to stream lines and have separated the rules used to match players in PvE from those used for PvP. Specifics on these PvP specific matchmaking rules are as follows:\nWhen attempting to join a friend you will be placed on their team if there is available space.\nIf you create a squad and then create/join a PvP lobby you will all be placed on the same team. Subsequent joiners will fill the opposing team slots.\nInviting a Friend who is currently in a squad will attempt to being in the full squad into your current game/lobby.\nAttempting to join a PvP match without enough space for you and your squad will now present an error message indicating that there isn't space to accommodate everyone.\nA similar error message to the above will be displayed when a full Squad of 4 players attempts to join a Lunaro match.\nInvite and Friends Only Lobbies now have a \"Switch Team\" option.\nAnother common gripe that has sometimes been affecting our competitive PvP modes was one that affects almost all games of this nature; rage quitters. While any system we introduce won't be able to completely solve this issue we've enacted a consequence system that will hopefully curb some of the more numerous instances:\nWe now track players who quit out of matches including those using the Alt-F4 method.\nThe Penalty system has 2 stages; a warning and a penalty applied state:\nThe warning stage will appear on the Landing Craft after the game detects that you've quit out of a match prematurely.\nThe Penalty Applied state will kick in after a certain % of your last games are determined to have been prematurely left. This state results in an XP Penalty of 75%.\nPlayer's can climb back out of the Penalty Applied state by completing a corresponding amount of full matches.\nWhile also negatively affecting rage quitters, we want to encourage those who continue to play while short on players and those who play multiple matches in a row.\nCompleting a match you were short on will result in a +20% boost to XP and Standing.\nCompleting subsequent matches will results in 10% more XP and Standing after the first match.\nWith the launch of Lunaro on Consoles we introduced full customization options for Lunaro controls. With this update we will be introducing the same functionality for PC keyboard and mouse users.\nHead over to the Options screen to configure your Lunaro bindings as you see fit!\nAnother major complaint directed toward our Conclave game modes has been the potential for laggy experiences due to the game running on our peer to peer system. With this update we will be rolling out the first stages of a potential solution to this issue: volunteer player hosted servers \nwe've got the tools in place to allow you to host Lunaro.\nAt this stage volunteer servers are limited to running Lunaro only, and require a separate dedicated computer to host.\nThe initial roll-out will be conducted via an invite-only process due to the need to gauge scalability and success. We will be using this soft launch to gather valuable feedback and stats and once we determine that the system is ready to provide the best experience we will be moving forward with a full scale public release.\nAffinity gained no longer converts to Energy in Conclave\nIncreased Standing gain at EOM based on Conclave Syndicate Rank\nShield regen delay decreased in Conclave\nShield regen rate

  "changes": "Specters Of The Rail: U2.1:\nDesecrate is now a toggle ability! Energy (or Health if you use the Despoil Augment) are consumed on Desecration. \nCorpses that enter the Desecrate radius will be eligible for desecration. The first corpse 'heats up' slowly for a couple seconds and then the rest occur in rapid succession (like popcorn).\nEach enemy desecrated will now cost 10 Energy (or Health if the Despoil Augment is equipped). This is affected by Efficiency Mods. \nHealth orbs are no longer guaranteed drops from Desecrated corpses. They are now tied in with the chance for additional loot drops.\nThe number of Shadows spawned has been reduced to 7 and is no longer affected by Mods. This is a necessary change for performance on all platforms. To compensate for this, Nekros now spawns stronger Shadows prioritized by heavy unites killed with Shield multiplier and draw aggro more heavily. \nShadows now live until they die with Health decay over time that is affected by Duration instead of Strength. \nShadows of the Dead can be recast while active to spawn new Shadows to replace dead ones, and refill the Health/Shields of the current Shadows. \n*Recasting Shadows of the Dead will also teleport your Shadows to you within limits. (if they are >10m and <40m away)\nThe Shield of Shadows Augment has been reviewed to maintain efficacy with these changes.\n\nVaulted Relics will now appear in the Codex (ie: Relics that are not currently in circulation that you may own).\nThe Codex section for Relics and Arcanes will now show items you've discovered but don't own (like Mods do so you can see the drop sources to farm some more).\nTweaked the TennoGen Mesa Falcon Helmet tint.\nUpdated the TennoGen Rota Syandana materials.\nIncreased the brightness of the Guides of The Lotus Sigil.\nUpdated the Burston mesh in the Stalker diorama.\n",

This allows most non targeted powers that damage enemies to work versus Arctic Eximus within a snow globe.\nRemoved unintended connection between Critical Chance and Kubrow base damage (this only worked for domesticated Kubrows; Kavats, and hostile companions did not have this behavior). \nIncreased Kubrow's base damage 150% and base Critical Damage multiplier from 1.6x to 3x so that for a Kubrow fitted with Rank 10 Maul Mod and Rank 10 Bite Mod the average damage would be almost exactly the same as before.\nWe’ve been reading a lot of constructive feedback on Relics, Fissures and the like since Specters of the Rail shipped. With your suggestions and comments in place, we are continuing to tweak Void Fissures/Relics where necessary with the aim to reduce repetition issues and tie this mechanic into the lore of Warframe. The Void is an entity that corrupts, and Void Fissures are no different.\nThere is no longer just one 'Void Fissure', Void Fissures can occur again and again as the Void's corrupting energy tears through the Solar System. Fissures now spawn dynamically throughout the level near groups of enemies. The Fissure will corrupt any nearby enemies immediately after spawning. This buffs the enemy, and resets their health/shields. It will also spawn a couple Orokin units along with them, some being Eximus after a certain amount of Fissures. Fissures despawn after a period of time.\nThe corrupted and newly spawned Orokin units have a chance to drop Reactant, which are auto pickups (no more context action). Once you collect enough, you qualify for the Void Projection reward, and one of your weapons or your Warframe will be buffed for a short period of time based on Era of Void Relic brought.

We've gone over every player ability and augment to provide predictable interactions with Nullifier bubbles and ability immune enemies. Below are the rules that we have adhered by to offer a consistent avenue for players to strategize against foes in-battle.\nAbilities will not affect players or enemies within a Nullifier bubble.\nEffects of an ability on both players and enemies will be removed when entering Nullifier bubbles.\nA Warframe’s active abilities will be deactivated upon entering a Nullifier bubble.\nProjectiles spawned by an ability will be deflected when they encounter a Nullifier bubble. For example, Ember’s Fireball and Ash’s Shuriken will be deflected.\nAbilities that exist independent of their creator will not be deactivated if the Warframe enters a nullifier, but will be destroyed if touched by the bubble itself. For example, Frost’s Snowglobe will not disappear when Frost enters the bubble, but will be destroyed if the bubble comes into contact with the Snowglobe sphere.\nAdjusted the enemy counts for each mission; in most cases the spawn counts were increased.\nImproved enemy tactics to better plan assaults on player-controlled towers; by staging units ahead of time they can be more effective and draw the action to different points around the map.\nChanged how the different types of enemy unit are sent into the fray. Historically you'd see higher-tier units mid-way through the first round and there would be no escalation after that; you should now see more infantry in the first round and then more support and heavy units if you chose to stay to intercept more transmissions.\nTuned the enemy tables to fix the cases where certain levels were 50% enemies that couldn't capture points (eg: Drones).\nCorrupted Vor in T4 Interception will no longer delay the end of round countdown (just the end of round) so that if he's the last enemy you aren't stuck waiting as long.\nFixed the problem where low-level Interception missions were flooded with Eximus’.\nAdded an Interception Mission to Sedna, Berehynia.\nSpoiler\nToxic Ancient's and Ancient Disrupter Auras will no longer stack with multiple Ancients of the same type.\nOberon’s Reckoning has a chance to make enemies drop health orbs which, when grabbed by you, heal your companions which revive them.\nFire rate Pistol mods will now affect Mesa's Peacemaker.\nAdded a PBR pass on materials for a variety of older Grineer and Infested levels.\nMade improvements to the spawn logic for Convergence pickups in Survival and Excavation missions.\nPhobos Tileset is now on Mars, and all Phobos missions are now on Asteroid Tileset.\nIncreased Dark Split-Swords Critical Chance while dual wielding by to 25% and Critical Multiplier to 2.5x.\nSlightly increased the Dark Split Sword dual wield attack speed.\nSlightly decreased the Dark Split Sword Heavy Blade attack speed.\nIncreased the Dark Split Sword Heavy Blade  Element Damage to 90 and Status Chance to 25%\nIncreased the Twin Basolk Status Chance to 40% and increased Elemental damage to 65.\nSlightly Increased Twin Basolk attack speed.\nIncreased Twin Basolk Ground Slam damage by 4x , attack radius to 7.5m, and Status Chance to 65%.\nTwin Basolk Ground Slams can now ragdoll enemies.\nIncreased the amount of Impact damage done with Stradavar automatic fire while decreasing the Puncture and Slash damage these attacks do.\nIncreased the amount of Puncture damage done with Stradavar semi-automatic fire while decreasing the amount of Slash damage these attacks do.\nSlightly decreased the amount of damage done by Stradavar automatic fire and increased the amount of damage done by semi-automatic attacks.\nIncreased the Stradavar Status Chance to 15%.\nPolished the hit detection of melee weapons within Nullifier bubbles. Some weapons, like the Tonbo for example, would strike the Nullifier bubble first, followed by the Nullifier agent in the same strike. However, the damage would only result on the bubble! The weapons can now strike both the bubble and the agent on the same strike, and the agent will take damage as long you are inside the bubble for the attack.\nRemoved in-mission challenges for all Mastery rank tests.\nRemoved two small sections on Nyx Prime that were un-tintable.\nAdjusted the Market icon size of the Akstilleto and Ballistica.\nChanged the way lighting works on Sigils in an attempt tone down excessive bloom.\nSortie Missions can now have more environmental wrinkles, traps, and obstacles within. Stay Alert!\nMade improvements to the animation look and feel of thrown weapons while holding a Datamass.\nAs a result of wanting to reduce the amount of playerbase splitting that the Syndicate Mission rank generation created, we've reduced this to simply have 7 missions per Syndicate.\nAt Rank 1 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 1, 2, 3.\nAt Rank 2 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 2, 3, 4.\nAt Rank 3 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 3, 4, 5.\nAt Rank 4 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 4, 5, 6.\nAt Rank 5 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 5, 6, 7.\nAs a result, now you are more likely play with other members of the Syndicate at close ranks to you. You will still now have 3 Syndicate missions active in your World state menu, but you should now have more people do them with!\nWarframe Helmet blueprints are now labeled as ‘Neuroptics’. Please note that when trading components, full Warframe sets now contain Systems, Chassis, and Neuroptics (previously Helmet) as components.\nPolished a variety of environment materials that were too bright.\nPolished a variety of old tileset decoration placements and layouts.\nPlayers can now choice to cancel an undesired squad migration if the migration is occurring while in a lobby.\nUpdated certain interactable Orokin Derelict consoles with new meshes.\nImproved your Sentinels responsiveness to catching up to you and staying at shoulder level when you're moving quickly.\nRescue targets can now shoot while following players. Teleport actions will still take precedent over this behavior when making your way to extraction.\nReduced the Syndicate buff FX to help aiming visibiltiy as per:\nIncreased the spawn rate of Rare Crates in The Jordas Verdict to match the Law of Retribution.\nThe Archwing ability stat screen will now show the correct range for abilities depending on context. (E.g. Blink used to show 100m, but in space you are 0.25x scale so distances are effectively 4x as far. So in space Blink will now show 400m. In water ranges are reduced, so Blink will show 39.69m.)\nGave Rescue hostages their own (incredibly generous) cover evaluators so their cover findings don't conflict with their behaviour. Gave them larger vision range so they react to dangers behind / next to them and not just when they get shot by them first.\nImproved finisher hit detection for multiple weapons. Reticles will now flash red when a finisher can be performed and with each hit for multistrike finisher moves.\nMultistrike finisher moves will have their damage split amongst each hit instead of now being delivered all at the end.\nPropaganda Drone damage reduction buffs no longer stack.\nImproved jump detection. Before players could prematurely double jump when just about to fall off a ledge, when falling off a small edge, or when walking down a steep incline. Regular jumps will now be performed in these scenarios.\nImproved Dojo and Liset decoration placement code.\nVauban’s Bastille now works on Corpus air units. (Attack Drones, etc.)\nIncreased the drop rate of Automatic Trigger.\nIncreased the drop rate of Vermillion Storm.\nImproved squad merging code to better facilitate Lunaro matchmaking.\nImproved migration code to better handle migrations occurring during PvP team selection phase.\nArchwing augment mods now display an <ARCHWING> tag to help differentiate them.\nImprove the physics on the Ki Teer Syandana.\n\n",
  "fixes": "\n\nSpecters of the Rail – changes to the Origin System are here, Tenno. What ghosts lurk the chambers of abandoned Junctions of a past era?\nFind a new way to experience the Origin System with the complete rework of the Star Chart.\n \nThis redesign of the original Star Chart will bring back the nostalgic roadmap design making it easier for you to travel the Origin System. The map is dynamic; zoom in and out and drag your way around the Origin System. Specific regions and missions will be easier to locate. Also, it will be clear to see which Missions you need to complete thanks to new Junctions -\nroutes between planets -\nguiding you on where to go next.\n \nWe've replaced and re-assigned many missions, including the removal of Deception and the not-so-popular Archwing Defense.\n \nDifficulty, planet progression, and enemy levels have been reassigned to better reflect the modern Solar System.\n \nDedicated memorials have been set up in Relays to display the names of contributing Founders!\n\nSpecters of the Rail live here \nyou must show you are worthy to conquer the Junction and ignite its Planetary travel power.\nJunctions link travel \nall players new and old must complete the Task list to activate the Junctions for progression and rewards.\nJunctions reward players with Mastery upon completion! Please note this Mastery reward is quite large, and offsets any Mastery points lost in the Star Chart changes of nodes per planet.\nVenus\nMercury Junction: Once Awake, Howl of the Kubrow\nEarth\nMars Junction: The Archwing\nMars\nPhobos Junction: Stolen Dreams\nJupiter\nEuropa Junction: The New Strange, Limbo Theorem Blueprint\nSaturn\nUranus Junction: Natah, Clem Quest\nUranus\nNeptune Junction: The Second Dream\nPluto\nSedna Junction: Hidden Messages Blueprint\nPluto\nEris Junction: Patient Zero Blueprint, The Jordas Precept Blueprint\n*Sands of Inaros Blueprint is still obtained from Baro Ki Teer.\n\nVoid Relic: Ancient Relics that react to Void Fissures to reveal treasures within.\nVoid Traces: Raw Void energy that drops in the process of uniting Relics and Fissures. Can be used to Refine Void Relics to yield more rare rewards in your Orbiter.\nReactant: Drops in missions and must be used in the Void Fissure sealing process.\nRefinement: The Process of improving the likelihood of Rare rewards from Void Relics.\nEra: An old Orokin age.\nLith / Meso / Neo / Axi: 4 Distinct Eras of the Orokin past, all suddenly manifesting through Void Fissures in the Solar Map.\nT1 Keys have turned into Lith Era Relics.\nT2 Keys have turned into Meso Era Relics.\nT3 Keys have turned into Neo Era Relics\nT4 Keys have turned into Axi Era Relics.\nVoid Relic Segment: Found on a Junction, used to Refine Void Relics.\nAfter years of new content releases and updated items to collect, there is a certain irony in calling the Void the “void”. Until Specters of the Rail, getting specific Prime parts was a repetitive and regimented process. Each Tower mission has a corresponding key and reward table, and if you want one of those rewards, you need to stock up on the appropriate key and repeat the same mission until you accomplish your goal. That all changes with the introduction of Relics. Instead of running the same mission repeatedly, Relics allow you to dynamically acquire the rewards you want by playing Fissure missions that appear on any planet, and there will always be Void Fissures active. Collecting cool rewards is a fundamental aspect of Warframe, and this new Void system is designed to make it more fun and immersive \nwith Void Fissures ripping into the very fabric of the Origin System!\n*Please note that Void Fissures will not be available for Assassinate and endless mission types \nexcluding Survival \nfor Launch. Further mission support will be coming shortly.\nRead the Developer Workshop here:\nSyndicate Void Key Pack has changed to Relic Pack.\nVoid Key Pack from the Market and Daily Tribute has changed to Relic Pack.\nAs for our good friend Baro, his sales/prices will be monitored closely to take new economy into account in terms of Ducat acquisition.\nAccess to the Derelicts is remaining the same.\nThe Refinement costs for improving an INTACT Void Relic are as follows:\nEXCEPTIONAL = 25 Void Traces\nFLAWLESS = 50 Void Traces\nRADIANT = 100 Void Traces\n\nSpoiler\nThis Update brings a huge change to the way our distance and obstruction sound works across all of Warframe. All distant sounds now feel properly spatialized and obstructed sounds now have the feeling of walls and more. Each shot, each character sound, each infested squeal will now bring you a more visceral and deep sound experience.\nWe updated many weapon sounds to have elements that take advantage of this new sound system.\nArchwing has been upgraded to a full six degrees of freedom! Now, you’ll be able to pilot your Archwing like a true flight simulator with full 360 degree yaws and pitches. (Note: submersible missions will still use the old controls)\nNew Archwing UI and control bindings to further enhance your flying experience!\nNew Eximus Archwing units have been deployed throughout the Origin System!\nSyndicates now offer Archwing components!\nReduced the total number of Archwing nodes to 8 \none of each type for Grineer and Corpus.\nArchwing Pursuit (Saturn \nPandora)\nHunt down a heavily defended Grineer Ship and destroy it by fighting through the ship’s defenses, such as: energy shields, turrets, and mines.\nArchwing Rush (Phobos \nKepler)\nReach hostile supply ships and destroy them before they escape. The more ships you destroy within the given time, the greater the reward.\nGet this Archwing today in the Market or Tenno Clan Research!\nThe Warframe Market got a facelift! Two big motivators behind this rework are pretty straight-forward: a) to make it easier to find what you want and to see what’s available; and b) to allow the Market to grow as more content is added in-game. Highlights of this upgrade include better item categories (especially for Cosmetics) and a brand new search function to help you fine-tune your results. A new hide/show owned button will make browsing for new gear a breeze, but for those who need to save up for the big ticket items, the new Wishlist feature will help you keep track of your must-haves. Feeling particularly generous? You can see your friends’ Wishlists and gift them what their heart desires!\nA large majority of Market-related complaints we receive relate to the confusion between built items (aka Platinum-purchased) and Blueprints. The current Market set-up can misguide players into thinking that Warframes, Weapons, and Sentinels aren’t craftable in-game, so we condensed the Built items and Blueprints into the same page. Information about build costs, stats, blueprint location, and more, will be separated into 3 tabs on this page to help players learn all they need to know about the item in order to make an informed purchase!\n\nWhile trying to make the Market work (and look!) better, we made some pricing changes as follows:\nFrugal Credits Bundle: 50k Credits for 50 Platinum.\nHigh Roller Credit Bundle: 175k Credits for 90 Platinum.\nLoki*: 175 Platinum\nMag*: 75 Platinum\n* These prices were swapped to reflect the change in Starter status.\nSpoiler\nFixed doors locking if a player enters and exits the

  "changes": "Hotfix 18.5.4:\nUpdate 18.5 contained a change made to ensure that enemies will no longer spawn in areas that have been cleared, as long as the level is not on alert.  This change was made to help prevent an exploit that caused enemies to rapidly spawn in the same room only to be instantly killed by stealthed players, and these enemies never scaled.  This was limited mostly to Deception Missions, but was present in Sabotage, Mobile Defense or Spy Missions as well.\nEnemies will now spawn in areas not yet seen by players.  This will allow players to clear rooms stealthily, while avoiding enemies spawning behind players and potentially ruining any stealth runs.  ‘Alerted’ enemies will spawn nearby and out of sight, but can also spawn in rooms already seen by players.\nThese changes will not affect enemy spawning in Exterminate, Excavation, Survival or Defense Missions, but will have a slight impact on enemy spawning on other Mission types.\n•    Loot Crates obtained in the Orokin Moon tileset puzzle rooms will no longer play rare Loot Crate audio FX which mislead players. \n•    Improved the lighting FX displaying on Squad ships seen outside the player’s Landing Craft.\n•    Removed item drops from Mastery Rank 4 survival test.\n•    Removed redundant Empty Relay Instances\n•    Cleaned up Kubrow barks and breathing.\n•    Chat is now enabled in 'Vendor Mode' in Maroo's Bazaar. \n•    The Provoked Mod now affects Inaros's bleed out damage.\n",

Please be conscious that some areas may appear overly or underlit. We will work to fix up any rough looking spots \nfeel free to send screenshots are way in bug threads throughout the appropriate subforums.\nWith Inaros, the sands of old have been swept away from U18 Warframe leaving behind a newer, more vibrant U18.5 Warframe. In many respects, 18.5 is a remastered, more HD version of Warframe with months of technical graphical improvements and artistic relighting of many parts of the game (and more to come in subsequent updates). On top of these changes are across the board rendering performance improvements we hope you'll enjoy, keep in mind that your particular hardware may benefit more and benefit less depending on your GPU, resolution and preferred graphics settings.\nLighting textures have been reengineered to reduce square compression artifacts and ugly color banding. You may have seen me point this out on past Devstreams.         \nAll PBR materials have been recompressed with a more accurate format, new and subtle details are visible on your PBR'd Warframes, gear and in the environment.             \nReflection Probes have been built through many areas of the game, grounding PBR materials with more accurate lighting.        \nCharacter and weapon lighting includes more accurate 'dual specular' lighting which means metallic surfaces are more realistic and fancy looking.      \nHDR rendering has been switched to a compact 32bit format which has improved HDR rendering performance for a wide range of GPUs.               \nTonemapping has been adjusted to use more of the range of lighting content in the game, images have more detail, particularly richer in the darks.        \nMotion Blur and Depth of Field have been re-engineered to run faster and look better, fast moving and defocused objects no longer appear 'cut out' on their silhouettes.          \nDraw order optimizations have been applied to every object in the game, which improves overall performance, particularly in worst-case scenarios.          \nAtmospheric fog effects are now rendering in a separate lighting pass, allowing richer particle effects at distance without being 'erased' by atmosphere.              \nParticle lighting has been improved to more accurately represent the local lighting environment.         \nWind force modelling on many particle systems increase realism as various environmental particles now respond to explosive forces and Warframe powers – you've also probably seen us showcase this in our most recent Devstream.         \nBloom system has been softened and made more seated in the scene. The burnt-out look is replaced with a more subtle and gentle sci-fi glow.         \nPhysics collision, performance and stability have all been improved, as a long-awaited upgrade of Warframe PhysX libraries has been completed.\nInterception AI Improvements\nEnemies in Interception Missions have been overhauled to help improve the flow of combat over the course of the Mission.  These improvements include:\nSuperior objective finding and hacking agent selection.\nBetter player tracking and more intuitive movement to Squad location.\nEnemies unable to hack (such as MOAs) will no longer move to engage hacking consoles.\nConclave Changes & Additions\nRecruit Conditioning has been enabled for all players who are Rank 0-2 with the Conclave Syndicate:\nPlayers who are Rank 0-2 will be matched together in matchmaking.\nEffects from Rare mods are disabled in Recruit matches.\nThis option is turned on by default and can be turned off in the Conclave Liset Console if you want to join matches with Rank 3+ players.\nThe option is disabled and removed for players who are Rank 3+ with the Conclave Syndicate.\nNew Annihilation and Team Annihilation Conclave Map: Orokin Moon.\nAll Capture the Cephalon maps with the exception of Gasworks are now playable in Annihilation and Team Annihilation.\nMesa and Hydroid are now playable in Conclave.\nThe Akzani and Akjagara are now available for use in Conclave.\nNew Mods added to End of Mission Rewards for all game modes:\nRapid Consequence (Sniper) \nOn Kill, +50% reload speed for 3 seconds.\nStatic Alacrity (Staticor)

Echoes of the Sentient is here!\n\nThere is so much to explore in this massive, new update! Move through the Solar System in an entirely new way with a completely overhauled Parkour system.

  "fixes": "\n\nWork with Cephalon Simaris to find the source of a mysterious voice. Something is out there, and it is hunting. Work with Simaris to track it down and discover its true nature.\n\nIn order to obtain this new Quest, players above Mastery Rank 5 must first visit Cephalon Simaris in his Sanctuary after completing the Stolen Dreams Quest.  From there players can acquire The New Strange and accept it from the Codex once they return to the Liset.\n\nA master of the deadly elements, Chroma can alter his damage output by changing his energy coloring.\nChroma’s powers include:\n\n\nTenno are out for vengeance, and Grineer Councilor Vay Hek has nowhere left to hide.  Hot on his trail after the assault on Relays during Eyes of Blight, the Lotus will guide a precision strike force to hunt down and put an end to Vay Hek once and for all.  Be wary Tenno.  Numbers alone will not protect you when diving into the heart of Grineer military power.\n\nCreate a squad of 4 to 8 Tenno and work through three challenge scenarios as you track down Vay Hek across the Solar System.\nEarn Arcane enhancements from defeating Vay Hek, each of which provide a unique bonus Warframes can unleash during combat.\nIn order to equip an Arcane enhancement players must construct it in their Foundry under the Miscellaneous tab.\nPlayers will then need to select what Helmet or Syandana they would like the Arcane to be attached to.\nAfter construction the Arcane Helmet or Arcane Syandana will appear in their Arsenal under Attachments.\nThe Law of Retribution Key Blueprint is available for purchase in the marketplace for 100,000 Credits.\nThis Mission can be completed with a minimum of 4 Tenno for an additional challenge.  Enemies will not scale down in difficulty with fewer players present in the Mission.\n\nCephalon Capture is our latest PvP game mode available on the Conclave Console in the Liset, and with its arrival come a slew of new changes to our existing PvP system.  The following are a list of general changes to PvP immediately available in Update: Sanctuary:\nPlayers will only be allowed to select Warframes from an existing list of warframes balanced exclusively for PvP 2.0.  This list will be expanded upon in future Updates and currently includes:\nMag\nChroma\nExcalibur\nFrost\nRhino\nVolt\nPlayers will be limited to Weapons and Mods that have balanced exclusively for PvP.  This list will be expanding upon in future Updates.\nPlayers can access their unique Conclave loadouts from the Arsenal by selecting ‘Select Mode’, followed by ‘Conclave’.\nCephalon Capture has three maps on launch that will rotate between rounds!\nCephalon Capture now features Challenges that can be unlocked while fighting against your fellow Tenno.\nWith our expansion to PvP 2.0 comes a new figure to guide Tenno through the Conclave’s trials and toward the path of enlightenment.  Teshin, a survivor of the Orokin Era, disagrees with the Lotus’ policies and strives to see Tenno break free of that which restrains their potential.\n\nTeshin and the Conclave Syndicate have established their presence in the Northern Wing of any Relay, and offer unique Syndicate rewards for Tenno who represent Teshin when participating in Conclave PvP.\n\nIn the cradle of space on Tenno Relays across the Solar System Cephalon Simaris has constructed a Sanctuary with the goal of eternally preserving all life.  But Simaris needs your help, Tenno.  Using Simaris’ advanced Synthesis Scanner you must track down unique targets to scan in a Codex shared by Tenno all over the world, and help unlock exciting new lore and Syndicate rewards.\nSimaris is a Neutral Syndicate and can be joined by any Tenno regardless of current Syndicate allegiance.\nSynthesis Scanners can be equipped like regular Gear, and are used in the same fashion a Codex scanner is.\nRunning a Mission that features a targeted enemy will prompt a notification from Simaris, making it a little easier to hunt targets.\nEnemies scanned will be tracked by Simaris unlock a global Codex of lore, in addition to providing affinity toward Simaris’ unique Syndicate rewards.\nWhile playing in Missions Rare Spawn enemies with unique abilities may appear.  These enemies will be more difficult to scan, and Synthesis can have dangerous side-effects on targets scanned.\nScanning targets will earn affinity with Simaris, and earning affinity with Simaris will not decrease Standing earned with other Syndicates.\n\nNew Ability Augment Mods\n\nNew Conclave Mods\nNew Cephalon Simaris Mods\n\nThe following Mods can be purchased through Cephalon Simaris in the Relay Sanctuary with Standing.\n\nKohmak \nLike the larger Kohm, this hand-shotgun doubles its volley with every successive shot.\nRipkas \nMotorized saw fists usable in close combat\n.\nFour Riders \nA claw Stance

After a couple years of talk, we finally were able to set up a Test cluster which could be accessed externally. This Test cluster housed the many iterations of Update 16 content.\n\nFor 1 week straight leading up to this update, a group of just under 20 veteran Tenno spent hours and hours each day playing together, giving feedback, finding bugs, and voicing concerns. Each day included tireless attempts at the incredibly difficult Raids, hilarious moments competing in PvP, and general exploration of all things new. This past week has been one for the memory books \nabout 60+ hours together with veteran Tenno who applied their skill to some of our hardest and most surprising content yet. I loved every minute of it, and I can’t wait to see what we can do for quality with the potential that this Test cluster has opened!\nRebecca\n",

Embrace your inner secret agent, Tenno!\n\nThe Grineer have put out a capture order for a thief named Maroo – they claim she double crossed them and has sold precious Arcane Codices to the Corpus. Concerned for Maroo’s safety – and excited at the idea of a new Arcane Codex – the Lotus is requesting that you bring Maroo in.\n\nThink fast, Tenno! You must plan your actions quickly and accordingly in this Quest. Failure to do so may alert the enemy to your presence and the Arcane Codex data may be destroyed.\n\nComplete this Quest and you’ll be rewarded with an Ether Dagger Blueprint and a Catalyst Blueprint.\n\nThis new Quest is available for all players Mastery Rank 3 or greater.\n\n\nWhile our old Spy game mode certainly had small spy-like focus in stealing intel, most of the time players were happy to loudly murder their way through the enemy to get the job done.  Who could blame anyone?  That’s why we sat down and gave Spy a total overhaul.\n\nWith new elements focused on avoiding laser grids and sneaking past guards, stealth is paramount in Spy 2.0.  Being detected will mean losing rewards and bonus Affinity, even when the Mission is complete.\n\nThe following nodes have been updated to include this new Spy game mode:\n\nMercury \nSuisei\nVenus \nVesper, Unda\nMars \nMartialis\nJupiter \nAdrastea\nSaturn \nTitan, Aegaeon\nUranus \nUmbriel, Rosalind\nNeptune \nSao, Laomedeia\nPluto \nOceanum\nCeres \nLex, Hapke\nEris \nCyath, Gnathos\nSedna \nTikoloshe, Scylla\nEuropa \nArmaros, Valac\nPhobos \nGrildrig, Shklovsky\n\n\nJoining our updated Spy 2.0 are some exciting improvements to stealth combat!  Players will now find that sneaking around each Mission may come with some excellent rewards.  These alterations to stealth gameplay will continue to evolve based upon player feedback, but for now stealth aficionados can sink their teeth into the following changes:\n\n\n\nWe’ve made a wide variety of improvements to Warframe in some obvious, and not-so-obvious ways.  The following is a quick list of changes we’ve made, and where you’ll notice them the most!\n\n\n\nThe following Mission Nodes on the Star Chart have had missing and mismatched rewards fixed.\n\nCeres \nBode (Capture)\nPhobos \nLimtoc, Todd (Capture)\nUranus \nTrinculo (Capture)\nEuropa \nValefor (Excavation)\nEuropa \nZagan, Morax (Exterminate)\nEris \nViver (Hive)\nSedna \nUndine (Sabotage)\nEuropa \nGamygyn (Sabotage)\nIn addition, changes have been made for Defense, Survival, Mobile Defense, Exterminate and Rescue.  Previously these Missions were not properly balanced to reflect the Mission's enemy levels, sometimes resulting in fewer enemies than intended in higher level Missions and more at lower level Missions.\n\n\nTo simulate waves and grouped up enemies, previously survival enemy spawns cycled on and off for short periods of time.  While it was a simple way of adding the desired pacing, we found that it was possible for players to get 'in sync' with killing enemies at certain times which left gaps of time where there were no enemies to kill and no enemies spawning, especially in higher level Missions with four players.\n\nSpawning now fluctuates dynamically with each enemy spawned.  Max spawn rate is the same, but it's now the time between individual enemy spawns which changes instead of a blanket 'on' or 'off' state for all enemy spawning.  Hopefully you will start to see more consistent spawning in higher level Missions with four players, as well as squads of enemies attacking together.  In our tests we found that there wasn't a notable difference in low level Missions.\n\nSmall life support drop rate was tweaked to compensate for the changes.\nAlthough we have playtested extensively, we are always interested in your feedback.  Please be sure to let us know how these changes may have affected your gameplay experience in the appropriate subforum: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/forum/237-mission/\n\nStar Chart node changes have been made to balance the available nodes across factions, tilesets and difficulty.  The following nodes have received changes:\n\nSaturn \nKeeler: Changed Survival node to Grineer Asteroid Mobile Defense\nSaturn\n Cassini: Changed to Asteroid tileset (was Galleon)\nPhobos \nFlimnap: New Survival Grineer Asteroid node (was Deception)\nEuropa \nZagan: New Survival Corpus ship (was Exterminate)\nNeptune \nDespina: New Survival Corpus ship (was Defense)\nCeres \nNuovo: Changed to Galleon tileset (was Shipyards tileset)\n\n\nShields and HP are two critical elements to keep track of in Warframe, but when fighting enemies it can be difficult to keep track of how much damage you’ve taken in the heat of combat.  This Update contains new visual and audio cues for when your Warframe takes damage in combat.\n\nWhen taking damage in combat damage will sound different depending on if your shields are down or intact.  Additionally shields ‘breaking’ have a new audio cue to help you better keep track of when your health is exposed to enemy fire.\n\nAdditional Sound Adjustments\n\nThis Update includes multiple improvements to sound immersion.  Among these changes are:\n\n·         Improved audio on bullet impact, making it easier to hear where shots as passing by (or where your rounds are being spent).\n·         Improvements to the Grakata's audio.\n·         Sliding will now provide different sound effects, depending on what surface the player is on.\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of variables that go into making an NPC more or less deadly, and accuracy plays a huge role in what enemies are most feared.  These new adjustments to enemy accuracy will dramatically change how players handle foes.\n\nEach enemy will have increased (or decreased) odds of hitting a player based on the type of weapon they’re using.  Sniper rifles, for example, will have higher accuracy at long range but will be more difficult for NPCs to use in close-range combat.  Not only that, but our new system allows us to create custom draw rates that make some weapons more difficult for enemies to aim quickly with.\n\nThese changes represent an ongoing state of development for our NPC accuracy; and we welcome player feedback on this subtle, under-the-hood change to be made in the appropriate subforum.  For more information on our accuracy adjustments please check the following thread in our Developer Workshop: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/395422-npc-accuracy/\n\n\nSaryn’s Molt will now transfer enemies that ‘latch on’ to Warframes (Brood Mother Maggots, Swarm Moa Swarms, etc) instead of destroying them.\nOberon’s Hallowed Ground will no longer create a second AoE effect on a second cast when the Hallowed Eruption Mod is equipped.\nCasting Frost’s Snow Globe inside of a Snow Globe you previously created will combine the health of both globes, eliminating the old Globe in the process. This will allow for greater combat visibility as your view won’t be obscured by opaque stacked Snow-Globe walls!\nFrost Prime’s Ice Wave now has a bit of Prime flair to its visual effect.\nMag Prime’s Crush now has a bit of Prime flair to its visual effect.\nIncreased damage bonus to Excalibur’s Furious Javelin Mod.\nUpdated audio and visual FX on Volt’s Shock Ability.  \nThe following Augment Mods have had their duration increased from 24 seconds to 40 seconds, and their damage reduced from 125% to 100%\nEmber's Fireball Frenzy\nFrost’s Freeze Force\nOberon’s Smite Infusion\nSaryn’s Venom Dose\nVolt’s Shock Trooper\nNova’s Neutron Star Augment now has a max  range of 8 meters, in addition to some slight camera shake for effect.\nMade minor visual and audio FX changes to Frost’s Avalanche ability.\nRemoved the initial radial damage of Ember’s Fire Blast, damage and the Heat proc now occur on the shockwave as it expands.\nRemoved the white flash that occurs when transitioning into Loki’s Invisibility.\nSyndicate Medallions have been increased to provide 500, 1000 or 5000 Standing depending on Medallion rarity.\n\n\nItzal Archwing’s Support Drones will now gain the same color tints of the Archwing.\nThe ‘bounce’ effect that occurs when hitting an object has been reduced.  This should help eliminate any pinballing when hitting a wall in close-quarters.\n\n\nAuto-turrets will now be open on spawn.\nAdded health bars to Wyrmius bosses.\n\n\nSyndicate Daily Quests for Standing have received an Affinity overhaul!  These changes should make Syndicate Missions much more rewarding to complete, in addition to decreasing the Daily Syndicate Standing Cap for non-Syndicate missions.\n\nSyndicate Daily Missions now give double the Standing they did previously.\nDaily Standing caps for non-Syndicate missions for have been reduced by half (remember, this cap is determined by Mastery Rank).  For example:\nMR 0 could earn 2000 Standing before, now 1000.\nMR 1 could earn 4000 Standing before, now 2000.\nMR 2 could earn 6000 Standing before, now 3000.\nSyndicate Mission Medallions have new standing values:\nCommon Medallions are now worth 500 Standing\nUncommon Medallions are now worth 1000 Standing\nRare Medallions are still worth 5000 Standing\n\n\nThe following changes have been made to the Rakta Ballistica.  Future adjustments may continue to be made, and feedback on any weapon are encouraged to be posted in the appropriate subforum.\n\nRakta Ballistica’s crit chance has been buffed from 15 to 20 on charge.\nRatka Ballistica’s damage on charge has been changed to 5 Slash, 5 Impact, 90 Puncture.\n\n\nLighting adjustments have been made to Tenno Relays.\nVarious art updates have been made to Tenno Relays.\nReduced the number of locked co-op doors in the Corpus Gas City tileset for Rescue and Intel game types.\nThe Tar-Mutalist Moa, Sapping Osprey and Infested Alad V will now have their damage scale based on their level.\nImprovements have been made to glass and distortion effects in game!\nSinister Reach will now extend the Amprex’s chain lightning effect.\nUpdated sound effects on player and NPC footsteps.\nThe Lynx is now immune to Mind Control effects.\nMade various background art updates to Corpus Archwing Sabotage and Exterminate Missions.\nUpdated the Deep Freeze Mod to give up to 90% Freeze damage to match other elemental Mods.\nUpdated the North Wind and Shocking Touch Mods to give up to 90% damage to match other elemental Mods.\nAttempting to convert an Arcane Helmet will now display a warning message to confirm your decision.\nUpdated Natural Talent to now be a Rare Mod on Interception drop tables.\nAdjusted Ducat selling price of common Prime Parts from 50 to 10.\nIncreased the amount of Fusion Cores you get in Void Survival Rewards depending on tier of Survival being played.\nAdded a 3 x Orokin Cells to TIII Survival Rewards.                                                                                             \nSome Mission Ndes have been changed to the Grineer Galleon tileset (previously, Grineer Asteroid).\nThe bloom on Mutalist Incursion Tactical Alert Badges has been reduced.\nReduced particle effect trails for Kohm’s projectiles.\nPlayer HUD and targeting reticule will no longer display in Relays.\nWall running instructions in the beginning tutorial should now be easier to read and see.\nMission Extraction cinematics will now cancel all emotes and actions.\nVarious NPC changes have been made within Syndicates, adding more life to those who live there.\nNightmare Mode nodes now have an updated Icon on the Star Chart.\nMade audio improvements to Mission Transmissions.\nAdjusted the Kohm to shoot a maximum of 5 pellets, in addition to dropping the fire rate but boosting projectile damage to compensate for dps.  This should keep the Kohm’s damage relatively unchanged, while helping cut down on the graphical latency caused by the weapon.\nThe World State Window will now show quests that you can start, in addition to incomplete quests.\nAdded large viewing screens to the Relay Concourse.  \nNew Rescue Mission on Jupiter.\nPhobos Rescue tile was reworked for Rescue 2.0.\nRescue hostages will now stick closer to players, instead of moving at their own pace.\nRebalanced the MK1 Paris easier to use with comparable damage to the MK1 Braton.  \nVoid Mobile Defense maps have been reduced in size to cut down on the amount of travel Tenno need to do.\nSlightly reduced the Shield Osprey’s beam radius.\nRemoved puddle of water that would occur around ice floor panel in Void tilesets.\n\n",

  "fixes": "\n\n\nOPERATION EYES OF BLIGHT\n\nTake down the Fomorian Vessels!\n\nA message from the Lotus:\n\nVay Hek is making his move. We have just detected a Balor Fomorian traveling on an interception course with Vesper Relay. The beast moves slowly but if we allow it to get within firing range, it will surely obliterate our new Relay. We need to destroy it before that happens.\nIntelligence reports state that the Balor Fomorian’s power core emits a thick energy field composed of deadly omega radiation. In order to break through the field you will need to craft this Fomorian Disruptor. It will allow you to safely approach the core and when activated it will temporarily disrupt the core allowing you to inflict damage.\nTake note Tenno, the Disruptor is forged using recently discovered Omega Isotopes. These are a by-product of a Fomorian’s core and will only appear in and around planets with a Fomorian present.\nMove quickly Tenno, this is the first Balor Fomorian attack but it won’t be the last. When the others come we must be ready.\n\n\nThe Lotus\n\n\n\nFomorian Vessels will intermittently appear in the Solar System as event nodes. These event nodes will be locked until you have the Fomorian Disruptor in your Consumable Inventory.\n\nYou will receive a Blueprint from the Lotus for the Fomorian Disruptor. It will require Nano Spores, Cryotic, and Omega Isotopes to craft.\n\nBuild your Disruptor in the Foundry and equip it in your Gear Menu to start the Fomorian Sabotage Mission.\n\nOnce in the Mission, fly to the Fomorian. Once you’re close enough to the Fomorian you must disable the exterior Shield Cores so you can enter the ship.\n\nThe Fomorian’s internal Shield Generators are protected by a magnetic field. Use your Fomorian Disruptor from the Gear menu to disrupt the magnetic field, and temporarily expose the Shield Generators, allowing you to destroy them.\n\nWith the Shield Generators destroyed you can now deal damage to the ship’s Main Reactor Power Cores.\n\nAfter damaging the cores, escape to safety outside the Fomorian.\n\n\n\nCompleting a successful Sabotage run will earn you event points, and reduce the global health of the Fomorian.\n\nYour Fomorian Disruptor will be consumed after completing the Fomorian Sabotage mission.\n\nThis Operation is on now until Monday, January 5 at 12 PM EST.\n\n\n\nCompleting the Fomorian Sabotage mode successfully will earn you one Battle Point.\n\nYou can earn a maximum of one Battle Point per Fomorian. Repeating the same Fomorian will not generate additional Battle Points. These points will count towards individual rewards.\n\nFomorian missions with a higher level of difficulty will provide extra points.\nLeaderboards are available for players that want to compete for the best score during Fomorian Sabotage Missions. Your individual score is determined by the amount of damage dealt to the Fomorian Power Core during a single run. The highest scores can only be achieved by squads with coordinated deployment of Fomorian Disruptors, and efficient attacks on the Power Cores.\n\n\nClan Scoring considers the following:\n\nYour score will be based on the most damage dealt to the Fomorian Power Core in a given mission. Clan score is sum of personal best but divided by max clan size for that tier (ie: 10 for Ghost Clan, 1000 for Moon).\n\n\n\n3 BATTLE POINTS: Eyes of Blight Skin Pack (Badge + Rahk Fluctus Skin)\n10 BATTLE POINTS: Eyes of Blight Mod Pack (Magma Chamber + Searing Steel)\n15 BATTLE POINTS: Imperator Vandal\n\nClan Scoring: The Top three Clans in each tier will be awarded with Gold, Silver and Bronze Statues.\nTake down the Fomorian Ships, Tenno!\n\n\n\nPlayers can check out the Leaderboards for Operation Eyes of Blight here: http://content.warframe.com/dynamic/eyesOfBlight.php\n\nLeaderboards are updated every 15 minutes for Clans, and every 5 minutes for players.  Good luck, and may the best Tenno win!\n\nOmega Isotopes: Produced by a Fomorian’s power core, these particles only appear on planets where a Fomorian is present.  Omega Isotopes can only be obtained in non-Archwing missions where a Fomorian vessel is present.\n\n\n\nFixed Soma Prime and Vasto Prime not being visible in the Codex.\nFixed duplicate Stance Mods appearing in Codex as per: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/369502-duplicated-entries-on-the-mod-codex-shield-disruption-and-cleaving-whirlwind/\nFixed the Breach Loader Mod showing an incorrect description in the Arsenal.\nFixed audio issue when interrupting the Supra mid-reload.\nFixed non-Archwing Pistol and Shotgun Mods appearing in Archwing Missions.\nFixed the word ‘SCANNING’ appearing in the Codex for non-localized descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

  "fixes": "\n\n\n\n\n\nKohm:  The Kohm is a primary plasma shotgun with a unique held-trigger function.  For every shot fired in rapid succession the Kohm releases an additional bolt, growing more lethal with every pull of the trigger!\n\n\nThese past few weeks many of our Founders, Prime Access supporters, and players with Mastery Rank 10+ have had the opportunity to help us test what our Relays were capable of handling.  With our preliminary testing of Tenno Relays coming to a close we invite all Tenno to take part in our next phase, keeping in mind that Relays may still experience some adjustments over the coming weeks.\n\nPlease be aware that there may still be some fine tuning that needs to be done in making Relay Stations a safe place for Tenno to congregate.  Rest assured we will notify everyone immediately of any downtime Relays may require during this time.\n\nIf you discover any bugs during your exploration of these Relays please help us squash them by reporting all issues to the following thread:  https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/363241-relays-known-issues/\n\nTo make Tenno Relays a little easier to navigate, here’s a list of currently available features that range from brand new content to tips that will help make your stay on the Relay a little more pleasant:\n\nRelay Stations are available on many planets, and are a great way to meet other Tenno looking to complete Missions in that sector.\nPlayers can create or join a squad while inside the Relay, then use the Relay’s Mission Control in the Northern Wing to start a mission.\nPlayers can also alter their loadout in Mission Control, should they need a different build for a more specialized mission.  These changes will reflect to other nearby Tenno.\nEach Syndicate has their own room on Tenno Relays, and are more than happy to trade their usual rewards in-person instead of through the Liset’s console.\nSyndicate rooms each have a special representative that collects Medallions, a new Currency for earning Standing.\nVarious art and lighting updates have been made to Tenno Relays!  Be sure to explore and take in the new look and explore each of the multiple floors available in the Concourse.\nVarious NPCs within Tenno Relays will be a little more lively now that they have animations.\n\n\nBaro Ki’Teer is a man of rare and luxurious tastes, willing to trade a wide variety of his acquired goods in exchange for the unique items that Tenno often discover when traveling the Void.  While he is often in demand his appearance on a Relay is rare, heralded by Ducat Kiosks in the main Concourse.\n\nPlayers can trade in unused Prime parts for Orokin Ducats, the only currency that Baro Ki’Teer accepts.\nOrokin Ducats can be traded to Baro Ki’Teer alongside a sum of credits for unique Mods, weapons, and cosmetic items.\nBaro Ki’Teer’s presence on a Relay Station is random limited to only a few days.\nSome of Baro Ki’Teer’s goods are tradable with other Tenno.\n\n\nWhile exploring the Relay Tenno may discover Darvo’s Market, which is sadly not open for business at this time.  Even still, Darvo is never one to turn down a good opportunity to advertise!  Be sure to say hello should you stumble upon his developing storefront.\n\n\nMedallions are now available on Syndicate Missions.  Medallions act like their own currency, similar to Credits.  Each Syndicate’s Medallion may have their own unique look, but regardless of their appearance all Medallions count toward the same currency pool: Standing!\n\nWhen you’re ready to turn in Medallions simply head to your Tenno Relay of choice, visit your Syndicate trader and select how many you wish to turn in.  Different ranks of Medallions can provide greater Standing than others; so keep an eye out for Medallions and plan ahead when you spend them, Tenno.\n\n\nWe’ve been working with our Design Council to put more Augments together, as well as adding some of our own! The following Mod Augments are now available through the Syndicate Offerings:\n\n\n\n\nThe Corpus have begun salvaging their crashed ships on Europa for valuable goods, loading up heavy all-terrain vehicles with cargo for shipment off planet.  Their most treasured shipment of recovered goods has just been readied for extraction, and it’s your job to make sure those secrets go to Tenno hands.\n\nLocate the Corpus shipment, then guide it safely to extraction through the frozen remains of a Corpus ship’s crash site.\nThe Corpus shipment’s vehicle has been re-routed to draw power from Warframe Shields.  Defending the shipment (and one another) from weapon’s fire is the key to victory.\n\n\nFixed visual overlap on some objects within the Dojo.\nFixed players being able to see into the Void when in the Dojo’s Tenno Research Lab.\nFixed the Marketplace not properly updated item quantity when player enters a new amount they wish to purchase.\nFixed several locked doors in the Orokin Derelicts showing up in green.\nFixed player Liset decorations floating in midair in the docking station of the Relay Station.\nFixed players waiting longer than necessary to enter a Relay when in a party.\nFixed players not being able to see any visual effects when picking up an oxygen tank in Survival.\nFixed players being unable to enter a Dojo through the Clan menu when in a Relay.\nFixed enemies only appearing in small groups of 2-3 when playing on Ice Planet Defense.\nFixed enemies targeted by Trinity’s Energy Vampire becoming stuck in an animation loop.\nFixed issue that would occur from leaving a squad at the exact moment the host disbanded the squad.\nFixed certain Syndicate Mods not functioning correctly, or not displaying new buffed modifiers as per: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/361795-broken-syndicate-mods-thread/\nFixed load time delays during Archwing Mission deployment cinematics.\nFixed all visual issues related to Warframe Reddit thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/2oxq2n/im_sorry_once_again_ude_killerkarpfen_i_have/\nFixed Mesa’s Shooting Gallery buffing enemy players in Dark Sector PvP.\nFixed players becoming stuck in Mesa’s Peacemaker after repeated use of the Ability.\nFixed Ash’s Bladestorm targeting enemies immune to Abilities after the initial target is killed.\nFixed some Archwing weapons dealing no damage to Sabotage Mission objective.\nFixed Liset Foundry flashing an update for players staying on the Liset during a content Update.\nFixed the Tenno Lab not appearing on the minimap of the Clan Dojo.\nFixed the Patient Zero blueprint not appearing in Marketplace.\n",

  "changes": "Additions:\n\nAdded Rank display to item browsing, meaning you can now see what rank your gear is in the inventory. As an example, in the scenario of building an Aklex and you have three, one which is Rank 30, you can now see the item's rank in this new display!\nUnlisted 14.6.0 change: There is now a Dojo chat tab when in the Dojo!\n\n\nTrinity's Blessing is now recastable while passive damage reduction is active. This means you no longer need to wait for your Duration timers to expire before being able to recast Blessing.\n\nFirstly, an explanation in intent and next steps:\nDev observed and experienced the uninhibited blinding effect in up to a 60 M Range with several environments coming between Excalibur and targets. This prompted review.\nSecondly, the 14.6.0 changes have all been reverted as they were experimental and not intended to function in the way they did for this brief 12 hour window.\nThirdly, what you can expect down the road is Radial Blind functioning in a way that considers Line-of-sight. The 14.6.0 unintended version suffered from a lot of problems with this approach, and coming will be radically improved line-of-sight checks for Radial Blind. Targets behind cover that can still see Excalibur are blinded. Other bodies won’t inhibit their blindness, but walls will.\n\n\nFirst, a quick brief in the history of changes this Mod has undergone:\nThis Mod was originally fixed to not give a player energy for damage that was never dealt to player. When we added the damage predeath state in Conclaves, etc, the original fix was unintentionally reverted.\nThe 14.6.0 fix resolves issues where Rage + Quick Thinking gave effective permanent invulnerability because energy was being added to pool that was never dealt to player. With this change in mind, the combination of Rage and Quick Thinking may seem less efficient as before due to no longer giving effective invulnerability. The scope of this change is being monitored to ensure the usefulness of these Mods as a combination.\n\n\nChanged loading screen/matchmaking logic to move on if after 10 seconds Client is unable to properly join/connect. Elaboration: Fixes entire squad being stuck on loading screen while waiting for low end PC to load.\nChanged the attack ferocity of Corpus Mine Osprey: before no maximum existed on number of deployed mines, and now there is a maximum of 6.\nRemoved Kubrow roaming in Liset until further notice.\nTweaked performance of Local Reflections code on Dx10 and Dx11 to address potential FPS loss.\nPvP Bladestorm balancing:-Reduced maximum number of attacks to [2, 3, 4, 5] to address issues with players getting stuck in Bladestorm-ed state for up to 15+ hits.-Increased the PvP damage multiplier from 0.1 per hit to 0.5 per hit in an effort to keep damage output in line with previous values.\n",
  "fixes": "\nFixed issue with Captain Vor being unbeatable on Mercury.\nFixed an issue with Nova’s Molecular Prime explosions caused by self-destructing enemies damaging teammates and defense objectives.\nFixed issues with users connecting behind proxies being unable to update the game.\nFixed an issue where Lotus would constantly talk to you at the end of Survival Alerts.\nFixed a game freeze that would occur when attempting to fuse or change mods.\nFixed game freeze when focusing on the categories menu after opening the item browsing screen in Foundry.\nFixed interception console ‘hitswitch’ pushing AI through the terrain on Grineer maps.\nFixed navigation issues that prevented faithful Kubrow from joining in the fight against Lephantis.\nFixed issues with Void missions not pausing when playing Solo and hitting ESC.\nFixed several crashes.\n",

That’s why I’m concerned about the coming Balor Fomorians. I think we both know your Warframes are simply not sophisticated enough to stop them.\n\nBut I can help you... for a price.\n\nYou see, I have an appetite for the rare and extraordinary and I’ve recently learned of a fine substance known as Cryotic. If you are willing, I will supply the necessary equipment and coordinates for its extraction. In return, I will enlighten you with what I know about technology that could defeat this Balor threat.\n\nTo sweeten the deal I am even willing award bonuses to those of you who exhibit outstanding performance.\n\nI must say, some of you display the inklings of good taste, if our partnership is a success perhaps we will get to know each other better.\n\nRegards,\n\nYour New Associate\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay the new Excavation missions!\n\n\nThe Location of a ‘Scanning Device’ will appear on your minimap for you to locate.\n\n\nCollect Power Cells dropped by enemies, and bring them to the Scanner to activate it and keep it powered. You can track your Scanner’s power in the map on your HUD. If it reaches 0%, the process will stall until power is restored.\n\n\nDefend the Scanner as it searches for a dig site. Once the Scanner has found a site, it will appear on your map. Proceed to that location to find an Excavator that is digging for artifacts.\n\n\nTake caution!  Enemy waves will attempt to destroy the Excavator, and you must defend it. The Excavator will also continue to lose power. As with the Scanner, you must collect Power Cells to keep it activated.\n\n\nOnce the Excavator has uncovered the artifact, you may choose to Extract from the operation or wait for another Scanner and repeat the process.\n\n\nThere are three available Tilesets for this Operation.\n\n\nWhat is CRYOTIC (New Resource)?\n\nUsually found in extreme sub-zero environments, Cryotic instantly freezes anything it comes in contact with.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Excavator is destroyed before it recovers an item, the mission is a failure.\n\n\nThe Operation is on now until Wednesday, September 3 at 12 PM EDT.\n\n\nOperation Cryotic Front is the first introduction of a new mission type that will replace all Survival missions that take place on a terrestrial tileset.\n\n\nThis Operation introduces Cryotic, a new resource that will only be available in the Excavation game mode.\n\n\nAt each of the point levels below and you’ll unlock a new Tileset in the Operation. It’s your choice – continue to dig on Earth or take your efforts to these new areas. Note that each new Tileset will hold more difficult enemies but will provide the opportunity to earn points faster.\n\n\n\n\nWith each successful dig, you will receive an amount of Cryotic based on your performance (100 max.) The more Cryotic you earn, the better the Reward – so dig on!\n\nMore than 500 pts = Event Badge\n\nMore than 1000 pts = Ice Mod Set (4 dual-stat mods)\n\nMore than 3000 pts = Latron Wraith and the Polar Glaxion skin\n\n\n\nNote: The basis for the rewards is your best score in one single run.\n\n\n\n\nThe top three Clans per Clan Tier will receive Gold, Silver, and Bronze Trophies. For Clan Leaderboards, a Clan’s score is the sum of active personal bests.\n\nPlease be aware that people joining clans after the event has started will not contribute to their new clans score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Added new Colour Customization options available through 2 new packs! These packs are brand new colours that can be applied to your current Kubrow patterns!\n\n• Added a base palette pack that includes 5 colors you can play with for 100K credits!\n\n• Kubrows are now in free-roam mode on the Liset!\n\n• Price of DNA Stabilizers reduced from 100k to 75k credits.\n\n• Added a “Consign to the Lotus” button for unwanted Kubrows.  Fear not, the Lotus shall take care of them!\n\n• Additional animations for Kubrow Cubs!\n\n• Added Kubrow filters for Mods.\n\n\n\n\n\nArmor:\n\n• Oberon’s base Armor increased to 150.\n\n\n\nSmite:\n\n• Projectiles that are spawned after impact seek-to-target, not just spawned in direction.\n\n• Speed up projectiles by 50%.\n\n• Forced Radiation proc on the initial target.\n\n• Forced Knock-down on initial target instead of stumble.\n\n• Forced Puncture proc on all enemies hit.\n\nHallowed Ground:\n\n• Allies within Hallowed Ground can not be proc’ed.\n\n• Hallowed Ground will remove all existing procs from Allies.\n\n• Armour boosted by 5/10/15/20% per rank for all Allies on Hallowed Ground, with stacking being explored on multiple casts.\n\nRenewal:\n\n• Switch to toggle ability with smaller base cost and energy per second active drain. All Renewal benefits occur when projectile reaches target ally.\n\n• Boost Heal amount 200/250/300/400 per rank.\n\n• When target is fully healed, remove any active proc effects.\n\n• Allies affected by Renewal have slowed bleedout by 20/25/35/45% per rank. This is affected by duration mods.\n\nReckoning:\n\n• Forced Radiation Proc added to damage on targets.\n\n• Small radial blind added to slam impact, but only for enemies that survive the damage of the cast. This radial blind will be applied to enemies that move into range after it’s been cast and are blinded by the impact of those being slammed by Reckoning!\n\n\n\n\n• Made Vauban's Vortex scale with power range and duration mods.\n\n\n\n\n• Nyx’s Absorb has had it’s passive energy drain significantly reduced from 10 energy per second to 4 energy per second, and instead now has an energy drain based on incoming damage. This drain is 8 energy per 1000 damage. These drainage values are affected with the use of mods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• In an effort to compensate for more useful attribution of XP when triggering a chain reaction with Molecular Prime, the main XP is attributed to whoever started the chain reaction. Before, Nova would take the bulk of the attribution. Now,  the \"weapon and instigator\" carry through the whole explosion chain ( if Player A casts Molecular Prime and Player B blows up the room, Player B gets the kills and XP). Similarly, if Player A casts Molecular Prime to Crowd-Control and then use their slowed state to get a nice bow-shot, Player B get weapon XP.\n\n• Fixed some of the cases where two Nova's casting Molecular Prime would have unexpected results (explosion range and strength were always determined by the Nova who cast most recently).\n\n\n\n\n• Added HUD counter for Rhino Stomp to show how much longer you have left on your CC (and how long to wait until re-stomp).\n\n\n\n\n• Banshee's Sonar, and the Enemy Radar/Sense mods ignore security cameras and turrets.\n\n• Banshee’s Sonar now uses Energy Colour.\n\n\n\n\n• Saryn’s Miasma can now be cast mid-air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Changed FX of Laser Doors when affected by Mirage’s abilities to better indicate you’re safe to run through.\n\n• Update several Foley sounds: more updates to Tenno step, fixed rhythm and step events for wall running.\n\n• Updated Host Election code to work with new squad system (had been disabled since Update 14).\n\n• Added more details to error messages for invitation and join problems (we are hoping that more information will help us isolate any remaining problems with the invitation system).\n\n\n\n",

Before you would just slide and jump at the wall, but now, if aimed and the correct functions pressed, this will transition into a wall run.\nAdded support for additional aspect ratios.\nAdded in a graphics option to disable Anisotropic Filtering. This should help with increase performance by approximately 10% on Intel HD Graphics units.\nAdded an ‘accept all’ pending friend requests option as a context action under the accept friend menu.\nAdded a new Animation when you use a Revive in a session.\nAdded all 3 Diorama Winners from the Diorama Contest of days past! Congratulations to Casardis, 9Hopper, and FireTempest. Find the dioramas in the Codex!\n",
  "changes": "Molt has received an Art and Effects overhaul!\nMolt now removes Procs and Status Effects when cast.\nHysteria has been reworked with an entirely new animation set and sounds! Activate Valkyr’s Hysteria to play through the new combos and movement set!\nValkyr’s Hysteria now is affected by the melee ‘combo’ counter bonuses! The higher your combo chain, the more damage Hysteria will do!\nVolt's Electric Shield now has a countdown timer. In the case of multiple spawned shields, the time for the last spawned one will be displayed (similar to Frost's Snowglobe).\n\nScorpions will now be able to pull players who are ‘off nav’, which means on boxes or other areas off the main path.\nEnemies health is no longer capped at 65535.\n\nAll Crawlers move speed has been increased.\nNew animations for Infested Ancient reach attack.\nElectric Crawler Attack range fixed, now more likely to attack with his lightning.\nLobber Crawler has new effects on his lobbed grenade, making it easier to see.\nInfested Charger move speed increased.\nSuicide Runners will no longer explode on death if killed by melee. The death explosion causes stagger, and damage scales up with their level.\nInfested Leapers: Their leaping attack can be parried to nullify the stagger. Leap damage scales with their level.\nAll Ancients can pull targets (Pull can be blocked or dodged).\nAll Ancients \nbetter anticipation of knockdown attack. It can now be parried to nullify damage and the knockdown.\nToxic Ancients \nDo poison damage and gives all nearby enemies poison damage. Ancient and nearby enemies are resistant to poison and gas damage.\nHealing Ancients \nLinks with nearby allies, any damage they take heals the Ancient up to 150% health, and it scales up to reflect having health > 100%. Also reduces damage that nearby allies take.\nHealing Ancient now has Fossilized health, to be consistent with the other Ancients (was Infested Armour).\nLeaper infested can dodge.\nDisruptor Ancients \nAura that reduces radial and power damage taken by nearby allies. Attack damage energy, rather than completely drain it. Attacks of nearby allies have the same effect.\nThe following bosses have gone through a balancing pass to improve their scaling for groups of high level Tenno, we hope they are a little more challenging!\nGrustrag 3, Hyena Pack, Vay Hek, Jackal, Alad V and Zanuka, Sargas Ruk, Lephantis, and Captain Vor.\nSpeaking to the Jackal, The Jackal had some additional fixes to reduce the amount of stun locking possible and also allowing him to scale better with level. The health of his legs was changed to a % of his total health, which scales up with level, making it harder to knock him into his stun state. His stun timer was also decreased while the damage required to break him out of stun early was also increased and made as a % of his total health rather than a set value.\nMade several changes to the Derelict Survival mission to improve spawning.\nPolished the logic for connecting procedural levels.\nIncreased the number of connectors to increase play space.\nIncreased spawn room chance.\nRemoved tentacle traversal room (Giant open room which branches are navigated) from intermediate spawning, will only occur as dead end.\n\nRemoved the locked door to extraction, as it only limits the available spawn locations within the first 5 minutes.\nIncreased the number of small dead end rooms (caps) which can generate in place of red locked doors, providing more spawn locations for enemies.\nAdded some new small cap tiles for Asteroid, Settlement, Outpost and Galleon tilesets.\nRestructured the Derelict Survival procedural level so it has more small tiles between the main areas.  There are still three larger main areas which have life support capsule spawn points.  \nThe 'stacking' bug was fixed, capsules don't spawn instantly on activating a capsule if the level is full.\nThe first room's capsule spawns are no longer switched off after one use.  Since the first room is reused, each level may now have 2-3 more simultaneous capsules active before it reaches capacity.  Originally the level structure was a little different, disabling spawns was intended to keep players closer to extraction after moving on from the first room.\nAdded infested crawlers to survival enemy spec.\n\nOptimized game memory to improve stability for 32-bit systems and reduce load-times. This optimization includes up to ⅓ less data being loaded on boot.\nCompleting an Alert on a node you have locked no longer unlocks the node underneath.\nRemoved blood/dismembered Grineer from Excalibur's codex entry ...he didn't mean to hurt anyone.\nIncreased decoration capacity in the trophy room for adequate trophy placement.\nChanges to mod art: Decisive Judgement and Tranquil Cleave used the same image, now they don’t!\nChanged Ruk’s image in the “Enemies” section of the Codex.\nChanges to visual effect when Melee killing an enemy while Channeling.\nImproved performance on effects that use the the particle system.\nRevisited Nekros tinting.\nLoki Prime's decoy now holds a Lex Prime!\nMaterial updates to Corpus ship hull Cores.\nMade curved walls larger to better support wall runs in the Orokin Void.\nTweaked the Bow Idle animations on Loki, Mag, Valkyr, and Hydroid Warframes.\nImproved Melee Ground Attack position accuracy.\nTweaked the sound effects for all Warframes entering Smoke Screen.\nImproved the positioning of melee accessories on Boomerang weapons (Kestrel).\nImproved the cast sound effect for Loki's Radial Disarm ability.\nImproved the performance of multiple general environmental effects.\nLimited the max instances of Karak, Soma, and Gorgon fire sound effects.\nLimited the max instances of Cestra fire sound effects.\nLimited the max instances of Dex Furis fire sound effects.\nTweaked the sound effect for Loki’s Decoy cast and spawn in sound effects.\nPlayer's can no longer be staggered when quick Meleeing with the Glaive.\nPolished some of Tyl Regor's animations.\nImproved the cast sound for Volt's Speed ability.\nTweaked the weapon fire sound effects on the Corpus Crewmen and Moa.\nTweaked the weapon fire sound effects on the Dera and Hind.\nTweaked the sounds of the Grineer rifle melee attack sound effects.\nAdjusted the Helmet position of Corrupted Crewmen.\nImproved the performance of the Interception territory area indicator.\nImproved the visuals on Mag's Pull ability.\nLoki's Decoy ability deploy sound effect is now positional and will not be heard by players past a certain distance.\nIncreased the volume of Vauban's power cast sound effects.\nReduced the pitch variance in Axe sound effects.\nImproved the performance of a number of Forest Defense tileset decorations.\nImproved performance on the Torid and Drakgoon Effects.\nReduced the amount of resonance on Axe hit sound effects.\nLimited the instances of Corpus Laser Weapon fire sound effects.\nImproved the performance of a number of Gas City tilesets.\nOptimized a number of lighting assets in the Grineer Galleon tilesets in an effort to increase performance.\nRemoved blood decals from bleeding procs as this caused performance issues on certain terrain sets.\nTweaked the duration and fade on multiple Hydroid ability sound effects.\nOptimized a number of lighting assets in Corpus Ship tilesets in an effort to increase performance.\nImproved the weapon trail visuals on Whip type weapons.\nOptimized the performance of particle effects.\nTweaked the slide animations when holding Great Sword weapons.\nUpdated multiple Warframe dioramas with proper colors.\nImproved the Grineer Hit reactions to Radial Disarm.\nImproved the performance of Ash's Smoke Screen on lower end PC's.\n\n",

  "fixes": "\n\nOperation: Breeding Grounds!\n\nTenno, we have a problem.\nAlad V has developed a way to direct the spread of the Infestation. Using these newly engineered \"Hive\" organisms, the Infestation is able to corrupt a new ship or colony almost instantly. There are also disturbing reports coming in that the virus has evolved. It is now capable of absorbing and corrupting non-organic beings. Not even the robotic soldiers of the Corpus are safe now. The only way to stop the spread is to destroy these hives.\nWe have just received word of a massive outbreak near Eris. An entire fleet of Corpus ships has been exposed to this new bioplague. Alad V is almost certainly responsible. If Alad V's hives are allowed to gain a strategic foothold here, the Infested will become unstoppable. They will overrun the system in a matter of days. If we don’t put an end to this now, the Corpus, the Grineer, the Tenno...we could all fall in the wake of this horrible scourge.\n-The Lotus\n\n\nOperation: Breeding Grounds will include point structure that allows for rewards based on points earned in ONE SINGLE mission! This will be denoted in the UI in the \"Best\" field under the Operations tab to help you keep track of your current best score.\n6 points: Breeding Grounds badge!\n17 points: Dual Stat Fire Mods!\n48 points: Prova Vandal!\nThe top 3 Clans per Clan Tier will receive Gold, Silver, and Bronze “Breeding Grounds” Trophies! For Clan Leaderboards, a Clan’s score is the sum of the Best Point run for all members.\n\n\nDifficulty of the mission is increased in the following way:\n\nYou will notice a \"Total\" value in the UI under the Operations tab. The higher this number, the stronger the stink and more difficult the missions! All Tenno will begin playing ‘Difficulty 1’ missions with ‘Difficulty 1’ hives! But, this difficulty won’t stay at ‘1’ forever. The Infested can smell the carnage of your missions and will become more and more difficult and aggressive the more Breeding Ground missions you complete. It will take several runs for the stink of the Infested to stick to you. By completing more missions, you will encounter more difficult hives and more difficult enemies! These difficulty increases will allow you to yield higher points in a single run, with endless potential if you want to compete in clan leaderboards!\nNote: grouping together with other Tenno will have an affect on difficulty depending on the level of combined stench!\nEnjoy! We plan on making Hive Sabotage a permanent addition to the game down the road, so let us know what you think!\n\nFixed a number of crashes.\nFixed Conclave bug where Conclave Score check did not occur if you joined a session from your friends list or via invite. This bug allowed users with any Conclave Loadout Value to join any Conclave node, regardless of enforced restrictions (1300 CR loadouts joining 100-150 Conclave Nodes).\nFixed an instance of the camera shake visual effect appearing incorrectly.\nFixed certain Dojo rooms not having message boards above the room management consoles.\nFixed an instance of Fatal Attraction not working correctly for Clients.\nFixed a number of localization issues.\nFixed an issue with Orokin Shield drones breaking when affected by Radial Disarm.\nFixed an issue with players getting stuck in Ash’s Bladestorm.\nFixed an animation ‘pop’ seen when unequipping Gauntlet type weapons.\nFixed an issue with players using their Melee attacks instead of attacking with Hysteria animations during the ability duration.\nFixed an issue with abilities not being properly available if one or more abilities are not currently equipped.\nFixed an issue with Clients leaving Key missions sometimes resulting in the Host losing a key.\nFixed an issue with Clients sometimes being able to throw unlimited amounts of Castanas which they could not detonate.\nFixed an issue with the Large Corpus Exploding Barrel displaying the wrong image in the Codex.\nFixed an issue with conveyor belts in the Shipyards tilesets appearing to rotate in the wrong direction.\nFixed issue where Banshee’s Silence FX does not disappear when the power duration is cancelled by a teleport volume (falling off map and respawning).\nFixed Rubedo Skin not working on Rhino Prime.\n\n",

You may recall the existence of ‘red crits’ from many updates ago, which occurred with no clear formula other than “Synapse!”. Here is some clarity into the new system:\n\nThe brief:\n\nA weapon with a critical chance greater than 100% will receive 2 calculations:\n\n1) a guaranteed critical damage value \nthis normally appears as a yellow value.\n\nThis means:\nIf your rate is 125% you get one guaranteed crit and a 25% chance of a red crit.\n\nIf this Second Crit occurs, you will see a deadly Red crit value!\n\n\nAsh\nBlade Storm has received a rework! Now when the ability is used Ash will conjure up to two separate clones which will go on the attack in addtion to the player! This will allow the player clear out large groups of enemies even quicker!\nChanges:\nMiter base damage has been increased along with the flight speed and proc chance of charged shots\nIncreased Fatal Attraction's range and damage at Rank 4 and 5.\nThe Fatal Attraction precept will now wait until enemies are within range before the pull ability is initialized.\nTweaked the positioning on the Leg Armor accessories for a number of Warframes.\nAdded in an additional range based visual effect on Molecular Prime that should help with distinguishing the distance of targets affected by the ability.\nTweaked the Excalibur Prime Channeling visual effects.\nSpecters will now re-generate Energy over time now so as to allow them to continue to use Powers over long amounts of time.\nPlayer movement is now prohibited at the start of Conclave rounds.\nTweaked the sound effects for the Skana Prime.\nReduced the amount of damage dealt to attacking players when using Reflection in PvP matches.\nTweaked the visuals on Valkyr's Immortal Skin.\nTweaked the sound effects on the Moa Laser Disc gun explosion and Drone Explosion.\nReduced required scans for Grineer Rollers.\nImproved the animations for the Greatsword and Axe animation sets.\nThe first round of Interception missions will now be easier for Solo players with enemies spawning throughout the mission.

  "additions": "\nNew Enemy Type: Feral Kubrow – After the fall of the Orokin, these former pets were left to fend for themselves. Only the most vicious survived, evolving into deadly pack hunters that now pervade Earth's dense forests. Intensely territorial, the Kubrow will attack any creature unlucky enough to cross their path.\nNew weapon: SYBARIS \nA Tenno-crafted lever action rifle, Sybaris is equal parts elegance and executioner. Find it in the Market or Tenno Research Lab today!\nNew weapon: ANGSTRUM \nCapable of firing multiple rockets at once, the Angstrum is a handheld instrument of destruction. Find it in the Market today for Platinum or Blueprint for Credits!\nNew Warframe Customization \ncustomizable armor pieces! Explore the Daedelus set and the Eos set today! \nGrineer Shipyard Expansion \nCeres has had further missions changed to include this tileset expansion!Ceres \nHapke & Bode are now Capture type missions.\nAdded a Codex entry for Mag Prime.\nIncreased Color Customization options! You can now color your Syandana's and other Accessories separately from your Warframe if you so desire!\nAdded in a new \"Auto Vault Over Obstacles\" option to toggle on or off.\n\n\n",
  "changes": "\n\nBlessing:  On cast, Blessing restores all shields and health. Damage reduction for the duration of the skill is now based on the greatest percentage of health healed (ie:if you have a squad with members whose health you healed 30%, 40% and 90%, all party members will receive Damage reduction at the greatest percent, 90% in this case).  This should make the use of Blessing more reactive, greatly benefiting players that pay attention and monitor party health to maximize its effectiveness.\n\nReduced the time it takes for Trinity's Blessing animation to play.\n-Energy Vampire:  Will now pulse one last burst from the victim when it dies, releasing any remaining energy; this should make the power useful even when the enemy is killed prematurely.\n\n\n-Silence: Is now a radial ranged effect that moves with you. As enemies enter the radius/area, they experience a ‘sonic disturbance’ which they react to. This disturbance deafens the targets and affects their awareness.\n\n-Sound Quake: Players can now control when to deactivate Sound Quake, with the option to toggle it on or off.  Sound Quake will consume energy per second while active.\n\n\n-Absorb: Players can now toggle Absorb on or off.\n\nBoth toggling changes to Nyx and Banshee will give players more freedom instead of being locked in place while the rest of your team runs around.  It should also add a nice element of resource management to both Warframes, rather than being stuck in place at the cost of X energy.\n\nShield: increased size of Volt’s Shield for better team usage.\n\n\nUndertow: will now be toggleable.\n\n\nShuriken now has forced bleed proc.\nBladestorm now has forced bleed proc.\nTeleport now leaves enemy in finisher state.\n\nFurther clone changes to Bladestorm will follow in a future update.\n\n\nChanges to faction logic in Invasion mission on ‘homeworld’ planets. These homeworld planets are indicated by the planet description in game.\nDefender won't go into \"threatened mode\" until they reach somewhere between 33% to 66% ownership. At that point they engage in a more aggressive strategy to win a  majority land value on their homeworld. Once they are back to that value, they will return to normal until another “threatened mode” between 33% and 66% takes place.\n\n\nReduced the amount of motion blur seen from Volt's Speed ability.\nTweaked the Shield Down and Shield Recharge sound effects.\nAllowed the Corpus Rescue Alarm sound effects to now be replayable.\nOptimized a number of light assets in the Orokin Void tileset.\nOptimized the visual effects for Bleeding procs.\nIncreased the visual effects limit for Nyx's Absorb ability to account for duration extending Mods.\nReduced the visibility of Zephyr's turbulence to address performance concerns.\nOptimized a number of lighting assets in the Corpus Outpost tilesets.\nOptimized a number of lighting assets in the  Corpus Ship tilesets.\nOptimized a number of lighting assets in Grineer Asteroid tilesets\nChanged the damage type that is used to calculate the damage of Melee Finishers which will cause Melee Finisher damage to be a multiple much like the way ground hits are currently calculated.\nTweaked the sound effects for many of Hydroid's abilities.\nTweaked the ambient sound effects heard in the Forest tileset.\nTweaked the visuals on the Misa Syandana.\nSet a max limit on the max instances of Frost's Snow Globe sound effects.\nExtended the maximum possible duration on Sound Quake's sound effects to take into account duration extending Mods.\nOptimized the type of collision calculations used on certain Grineer settlement art assets to address performance concerns.\nCeres \nHapke & Bode are now Capture type missions.\nCeres \nKiste is now a Mobile Defense mission.\nMod shown during loading screens will now display the max level Mod stats.\nBlueprint mods are now highlighted to differentiate them from other drops.\nTweaked the visual effects for destroying security cameras.\nVay Hek can no longer be affected by mind control abilities.\nAsh' Blade Storm will now deal multiplied damage based on the current Combo Hit multiplier\nTweaked the reload sound effects for the Afuris\nAdded in a number of HUD timers for numerous Warframe abilities:\nVauban’s Bastille\nVauban’s Vortex\nBanshee’s Sonar\nEmber’s Fire Blast\nTweaked the sounds for Desert Skates.\nOptimized the shading effect on very bright energy colors to help reduce any apparent color bleeding effects.\nImproved the way the Auto-Fuse algorithm would select cores for Fusion. The Auto-Fuse functionality will now attempt to calculate the most optimal amount of Mods to fuse to reduce the amount of overflow and wastage!\nThe Distribute Resource button has how been separated into two separate buttons with distinct functionality. One button will be used for distributing credits and the other will be used to distribute miscellaneous items.\nTweaked the ability and energy visuals on numerous Warframes including Rhino, Frost, Nova, Ash, Banshee, Zephyr, Vauban, Volt and Valkyr.\nAdded in a better quality Swift Death Mod card image.\nImproved the Fusing process for Mods already installed on weapons. You will now receive a prompt informing you that the Fusion process will exceed the capacity on the specific weapons that the Mod is installed on and will ask you whether you would like to uninstall the mod and continue with the Fusion process or cancel the Fusion entirely.  If there are multiple Fusion conflicts these will be displayed sequentially.\nCreated a more robust warning for the last Clan leaving an Alliance informing them that all resources including Solar Rails will be destroyed in the process\n\n\n\n",

  "fixes": "Hotfix 13.2.3\n\nNews:\nHelmets with stat modifications have now been removed from the Market/Alert Cycle. Previously crafted or purchased Helmets with stats have been grandfathered in and will not be affected by this change. Additional Stat-to-Stateless Helmet recipes have been added to the Market for individuals wishing to change their current stat modifying helmets to purely cosmetic versions. To coincide with this change, the ability to trade Helmets has been added into the game as well. While the possible options to execute on this change were many, we do not feel comfortable removing the stats outright from gear players have spent hours and hours waiting for via alerts or spent Platinum on. The agency is in the players hand to remove the stats, and we will monitor to decide if further steps need to be taken.\nAdditions:\nAdded in a number of Loading Spinners to indicating when certain screens are loading in new data.\nAdded in a new Battle Pay Reserve section to the Dark Sector Menu.

Changing this option now takes effect immediately (ie: no game restart required).\n\nMade all Warframe components sellable (1000 CR each).\n\nChanged Lotus transmissions to reduce chatter: added delay to Mobile Defense reminders, Heavy Unit transmissions now have a 2 minute cool-down and can occur at most 3 times per mission.\n\nLoki’s Invisibility no longer reduces the volume of dialog and music.\n\nChanged logic that determines visual representation of damage mods on continuous-fire weapons (eg: Synapse, Ignis, etc).\nThe frequency of damage numbers used to be limited by using a minimum damage threshold. Since damage mods increase the rate at which damage accumulates, this would cause damage to be inflicted more often though each damage event would not necessarily be larger. This led to people thinking the mods did nothing because they didn't notice the increased rate at which numbers would appear (an easy mistake for low level damage mods). Similarly, headshots would make numbers appear more often but not necessarily create bigger numbers.\nNow continuous fire weapons now limit the frequency of damage numbers by using a minimum time between impacts, regardless of how much damage has accumulated. This gives us a lot more control and should make things more obvious for players who are applying damage mods (it's easier to notice that numbers are 5% larger in magnitude vs being generated 5% faster)”\n\n",

See here for more info on this late addition to the notes: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/147063-dec-122013-ps4-u113ugh/\nSystemic Invasions 1.0 is live!\nGrineer & Corpus now periodically attack star chart nodes owned by opposing factions; if successful, battlefront moves to an adjacent node, otherwise faction \"rests\" before attacking another node\nThe Infested now truly infest! The faction has vacated the Star Chart and now exists as an Invasion faction! Keep your eyes peeled for signs of Infested threats – they’ll strike hard.\nInfestation \"outbreaks\" will occur at random, with a downtime of 12 – 36 hours between attacks. When a node is under Infested threat, battlefront aggressively moves to all adjacent nodes if invasion isn't successfully defended within a matter of hours. Outbreaks continue to spread until reaching a boss node, which leads to Phorid appearing and occupying that boss's node until the invasion is defeated!\nThis system is a new dynamic we’re trying out and will be standing by for feedback/suggestions accordingly.\nWeapon changes:\nBuffed Grakata \nHigher Proc/Crit chance.

Note that the total XP earned was 142% of what you saw on the screen – now it will be 200%.\nNow:\nRegular weapon kills divide experience evenly between your weapon and your Warframe (50% each).\nKills using a Warframe ability give all the experience to the Warframe (as before).\nSentinel weapon kills divide experience evenly between your Sentinel and its weapon (50% each).\nKills using a precept give all the experience to your Sentinel (as before).\nExperience from other players (shared experience) is split evenly amongst your gear as follows: a quarter goes to your Warframe and a quarter goes to each of your weapons (25% each).

Most of her lines have been re-recorded and now sound more consistent across the entire game. Lotus now uses a brand new DSP system to playback her audio files. Her voice has a more dynamic sound that makes use of some digital audio randomization so her voice effect will sound slightly different every time it plays.\nChanged Capture targets voices.

  "fixes": "7.7.1 Hot-Fix + \"About Last Night...\":\nSome of you may have noticed our change lists from yesterday were incomplete (/sarcasm).\nWhile we are apt to make controversial changes in Warframe until the end of time, it is our intention to be upfront about it*. How else would I maintain this supple flame-singed hue? We are formalizing how the changelists are compiled in the future. We will never be perfect, but we can do better.\nHere is what 7.7.1 has as well as important notes absent from the prior update:\n-Chat server upgraded to allow moderation, unified authentication and blunt the hacking attempts.\n-Increased the curve of AI damage/shields for higher level enemies... but then:\n-After more testing, toned down those same curves for high level enemies (split the difference).\n-Reduced simultaneous enemy counts when playing Solo.\n-Restored missing sounds (Hek).\n-Rollback frame-rate dependency fixes for automatic weapons (too much fallout, but this is fixed properly soon).\n-Added more blueprints to Alerts (Alt helmets, Weapon skins).\n-Increase health, shields and regeneration on Cryo-casket in Defense Mode.\n-Rare Mods are now... rare. Faction drop tables were boosting probabilities past Common in some cases.\n-Fix gear becoming unequipped after relogin/return from mission.\n-Fix default Exalibur appearing on title screen.\n-Removed work-in-progress loadout preset option (incomplete).\n*-excluding things we want to surprise you with.\nAbout turn-around time: We do not have moderation and customer support 24/7. I think it is heading that way, but it's not there yet. Try to temper \"Wtf no dev response!\" with that in mind.\nAbout chat: Chat moderation is ad-hoc, but if you're being a jerk we will warn you, kick you, ban you, then suspend your account. Remember the Tenno ways. Humor and Honor are not mutually exclusive.\nAbout difficulty: We are planning more difficulty choice to sidestep the Goldilocks problem here. As much as you think the game is too easy or too hard there is always someone who feels the opposite. Internally we felt the early-game was too hard, the end-game a bit too easy. The longer-term fix is to give players choice since one size does not fit all.\nNext: Bug fixes of course! This goes in tandem with new hotness. In the next few weeks expect tileset expansion, new weapons and more crazy Mods. Update 8 (dramatic cue: \"Rise of the Warlords\") has also begun which will be a leap forward for Warframe and breathe a sense of life and purpose into Warframe Clans.\n(Also note the absurd number scheme, don't take 7.7.x as 8 being just around the corner... it is not)\n",

While the content team was cranking on the next big update our coders (myself included) were chasing crashes and offline contact bugs. Things are starting to calm to a pleasant 'blistering insanity' level of urgency. Here is a list of all the ninja updates we did this week. Can't thank you guys enough for your patience with us as we smash our match-making and chased those loot-devouring crash bugs.\n-Fixed a long-standing memory corruption bug that was the cause of many random crashes.\n-Mod drop levels determined by enemy killed not your inventory.

Necessary for upcoming environment. Work-in-progress...\n-Preliminary in-game update message when updates are pushed (working on getting this to sync better with our CDN).\n-Hardware failure check to detect problems due to faulty RAM, overclocking instability, heat problems.\n-Signin rewards UI shows required days to reach tiers.\n-Added fallbacks when trying to join a session that ends while joining.\n-Fix chosen Artifacts cards not showing promptly in Front-end.\n-Fix double cameras after host migration.\n-Fix crashes in AI and animation.\n-Fix Corpus laser door networking issues.\n-Fix over-bloom on characters.\n-Fix for doors/elevator problems with join-in-progress.\n-Improvements to prevent accidental selling in Inventory.

Work-in-progress...\n-Fix elemental effects not showing on Scindo, Frago and many crafted Swords and Daggers.\n-Energy pickups are now shared with other players. More energy in Coop!\n-Fixes for Volt overload being over-powered, then under-powered. Does radial damage as well.\n-Fix quit exploits with Alerts.\n-Fix revive from Pause menu.\n-Prevent join-in-progress of late-stage missions.\n-Relax video card restrictions in Launcher.\n-Fix Artifacts not applying with join-in-progress.\n-AI will not incorrectly target Turrets anymore.\n-Update APEX libraries to improve Nvidia PhysX Effects stability.\n-Add help option for chat commands.\n-Fix Shotgun Ammo Pack reward being 0.\n-Fix disarm exploit for some bosses.\n-Fix for Contacts list not working when you have large number of Contacts/Clan members.\n-Additional attack animation for Scindo and Frago\n-Alert enemy levels are now using their region level range.\n-Stamina Mods for Warframes added.\n-Fix Corpus Security Cams being alert when they shouldn't. Work-in-progress...\n-Fix chat window input text being erased as presence changes came in.\n-Fix Warframe Armor Mods being most common type.\n-Disabled non-XInput joystick enumeration that was causing instability.\n-Improvements to 'massive lag' problems caused when a client re-joins a session they had left.\n-Fix \"too many\" Ancients in some missions.\n-Fixes to Mod drop levels / rarity.\n-Crash fixes during update.\n-Rank exploits fixed.\n-Fixed a few cases where setting wouldn't save (illegal characters).
